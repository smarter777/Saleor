# Writing

## Language
You can use Polish ðŸ‡µðŸ‡±, English ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§, or mix of both.

We want the experience of writing to be frictionless for you, that's why we handle rephrasing and translating the content.

## Tooling
Everything you write goes through our editing process, but we would appreciate it if you used [Grammarly](https://grammarly.com/) for spell-checking.

## Checklist
Things to check before publishing:
- [ ] - proper nouns are correctly capitalized ("GraphQL", not "Graphql")
- [ ] - snippets and screenshots are up to date (especially when documentation is being written in parallel with the feature development)
