## Language
You can use Polish ðŸ‡µðŸ‡±, English ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§, or a mix of both.

We want the experience of writing to be frictionless for you, that's why we handle rephrasing and translating the content.

## Tooling
- [Grammarly](https://grammarly.com/) - everything you write goes through our editing process, but we would appreciate it if you used Grammarly for spell-checking.

## Writing
- **Avoid using passive voice.** We are writing tutorials and instructions, so it's more suitable to talk directly to the users.
- **Try not to use screenshots.** Screenshots come at a high cost of maintenance because they tend to go out of date quickly. If we need a screenshot to explain something, it could mean we are not doing the best job at describing it, or our UX is lacking. Only if we can't do anything about it, a screenshot is fine.

## Checklist
Things to check before publishing:
- [ ] - proper nouns are correctly capitalized ("GraphQL", not "Graphql")
- [ ] - snippets and screenshots are up to date (especially when documentation is being written in parallel with the feature development)
- [ ] - the technical names / variables are consistently formatted with a `code block`
