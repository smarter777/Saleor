## Introduction
Slug is a short label for an object. Main reason for using slugs is ability to encorporate them in URLs. Translated names can contain all utf-8 signs, which could lead to URLs which could not be written for people with different keyboard layout.

Slug can contain:
- letters
- numbers
- underscores
- hyphens

By convention slugs in Saleor are not translatable, so the users using different languages could use the same product URLs.

## Example

As example we would like to create product called "Żółta ćma" (Yellow moth). Expected slug for such product would be `Zolta-cma`.
