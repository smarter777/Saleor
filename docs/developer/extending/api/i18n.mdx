### Address validation

[Google’s address format database](https://github.com/mirumee/google-i18n-address) is used to provide location-specific address formats and forms.
It also handles the address validation so you do not need to know how to address a package to China or whether they use postal codes in the United Arab Emirates (_they don't_).

### Phone number format

Saleor uses [Google’s `libphonenumber` library](https://github.com/googlei18n/libphonenumber) to ensure that the phone numbers provided by your customers are correct.
You need to choose the prefix and type the number separately.
Regardless of which country has been selected, you may enter the phone number for any country format.
