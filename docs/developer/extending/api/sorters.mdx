## Key concepts

Sorters allow returning elements that are ordered based on specific criteria.
This document describes how to add a sorter to the query.

## Add sorting to query

### Step 1: Create new sorter GraphQL enum
To create new sorter enum, add `sorters.py` file in target graphql directory.
Inside this directory, create GraphQL enum with fields that can be used for sorting
and description property defining enum fields explanations.
Lets see an example:

```python
import graphene


class ExampleSortField(graphene.Enum):
    NAME = ["name", "slug"]
    VISIBILITY = ["is_published", "name", "slug"]

    @property
    def description(self):
        if self.name in ExampleSortField.__enum__._member_names_:
            return f"Sort Example by {sort_name}."
        raise ValueError("Unsupported enum value: %s" % self.value)
```

GraphQL field name define schema field, which can be used to sort elements,
and value defines list of model fields, that will be used for sorting. List can contains
multiply elements, the next value from list will be used when items has the same value
for previous field from list. For example, if elements sorting by `NAME` have the same
value of `name` field, they will be sorted by `slug` field value.

### Step 2: Create Sort Input
In the same file create Sorting Input with `Meta`. In `Meta` define `sort_enum` which
corresponds to just created sorted enum and `type_name` which is used to created sorter description.

```python
from saleor.graphql.core.types import SortInputObjectType


class ExampleSortingInput(SortInputObjectType):
    class Meta:
        sort_enum = ExampleSortField
        type_name = "examples"
```

### Step 3: Add sorter to query
Define `sort_by` field to your target query in `schema.py` file. Make sure that query using
`BaseDjangoConnectionField` or another type which inherits from this. Here is the example:

```python
import graphene


class ExampleQueries(graphene.ObjectType):
    examples = BaseDjangoConnectionField(
        Example,
        description="List of the examples.",
        sort_by=ExampleSortingInput(description="Sorting options for examples.")
    )
```
