## Introduction

Synchronous webhooks can be used for extending Saleor without the need to deploy plugins on the API server.

:::warning
Adding synchronous webhooks will affect Saleor API response time. Make sure that the App server can keep up with customer's requests.
:::

These webhooks are run from the Saleor Core instance during GraphQL requests. As a result, the response data is sent to the client.

## Webhook protocol

Synchronous webhooks support only HTTP(S).

Webhook payloads are sent in POST requests.
