## Introduction

Synchronous webhooks can be used for extending Saleor without the need to deploy plugins on the API server.

:::warning
Adding synchronous webhooks will affect Saleor API response time. Make sure that the App server can keep up with customer's requests.
:::

These webhooks are run from the Saleor Core instance during GraphQL requests. As a result, the response data is sent to the client.

## Webhook protocol

Synchronous webhooks support only HTTP(S).

Webhook payloads are sent in POST requests.

### Headers

During HTTPS requests there are several headers included:

- `Saleor-Event` - defines an event which is assigned to the webhook
- `Saleor-Domain` - defines a Saleor domain
- `Saleor-Signature` - defines the signature to indicate that the request is verifiable

Saleor gives you an option to add custom headers to the request (available since version 3.12). Currently supports `Authorization*` and `X-*` keys with limitations of 5 headers per webhook and 998 characters per header. To check how to add `customHeaders` go to [Subscribing to webhook](/docs/developer/extending/webhooks/asynchronous-events.mdx#subscribing-to-a-webhook).

### Payload signature

Saleor calculates the payload signature under `Saleor-Signature`. Check [Payload signature](developer/extending/webhooks/payload-signature.mdx) page for more details.
