Saleor can send real-time notifications or data to another application or service using Webhooks.

Webhooks are available in Saleor to both Local and External Apps. Local App is an entity tightly integrated into Saleor whereas External App is an externally hosted application that can communicate with Saleor API and integrate into Saleor Dashboard.

If your external system or service needs to receive data based on events happening in Saleor you can use Webhooks through Local Apps. In order to do that you need to create Local App which can be used to define Webhooks.
