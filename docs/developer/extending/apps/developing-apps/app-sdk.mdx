## Overview

We recognize the complexity of building a Saleor app from scratch. At the same time, we want to empower you to develop the way you like it. With those principles in mind, we created `@saleor/app-sdk`.

`@saleor/app-sdk` is a TypeScript-first npm library that serves as a foundation for every Saleor app. It includes helpers built for React and Next.js.

**The documentation** for `@saleor/app-sdk` is being maintained [in its repository](https://github.com/saleor/saleor-app-sdk/tree/main/docs).

You can find `@saleor/app-sdk` on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@saleor/app-sdk) and [GitHub](https://github.com/saleor/saleor-app-sdk).

## Installation

```shell

## Versioning

`@saleor/app-sdk` uses semver. [Releases and changelogs are tracked in GitHub](https://github.com/saleor/saleor-app-sdk/releases).

Currently, the SDK is in the pre-1.0 phase, meaning the API is unstable. We do our best to minimize breaking changes.
