title: Apps Examples
---

We decided to be very deliberate with the code we ship inside the [Saleor App Template](./app-template.mdx). That means it only contains what is necessary to start building your Saleor app.

Most likely, you want to learn by example. That's why we created an example repository that stores patterns, use cases, and integrations with other libraries or vendors.

It's called App Examples and you can find it [here](https://github.com/saleor/app-examples).
