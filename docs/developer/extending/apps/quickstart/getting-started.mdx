## Overview

In this tutorial, we will walk you through the basic steps of building a Saleor app.

By the end of it, you will have built an **Abandoned Checkouts** app. It will fetch and display data about checkouts that for some reason haven't been turned into orders. The view we will develop may provide useful insight for investigating the causes of the undesired behavior.

## Prerequisites

### Knowledge

In the tutorial, we will introduce you to some Saleor app concepts. To make the most of them, you need to be familiar with several technologies.

The articles featured in this series will include the basics of:

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/)
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)

Regardless of the purpose of this tutorial, we highly recommend learning them. These technologies make our standard stack and we use them in all sorts of different applications.

### Saleor CLI

This tutorial relies on a technology we are deeply proud of: [Saleor CLI](cli.mdx). We will use it to spawn an app boilerplate.

To download and install Saleor CLI, run the following command:

```shell
npm i -g @saleor/cli
```

After installation, you can display all the available commands by running the following in your terminal:

```shell
saleor
```

### Saleor account

#### Login to your existing Saleor account

Before starting the development, please make sure you are logged in to your Saleor Cloud account. To log in let's type:

```shell
saleor login
```

The command will redirect you to a webpage with authentication. There, you need to pass in your login credentials. After a successful login, you can come back to the CLI.

If your user is assigned to an organization and you have an existing project you want to build an app for, you can go all the way to the next page. See you there ðŸ‘‹!

#### Create a new Saleor account

If you have no prior experience with Saleor, that's okay! Please create a new account with the command:

```shell
saleor register
```

The wizard will walk you through the registration process.

#### Create your organization

If you haven't done it already, we need to ensure that you are assigned to an organization before we continue. If that's not the case, please create an organization in the [Saleor Cloud dashboard](https://cloud.saleor.io/) after you have logged in.

#### Create your project

Unless you want to assign your app to an existing project, we will need to create one.

You can do so from the Saleor Cloud dashboard but since we made all the effort to install the Saleor CLI, let's make the most out of it!

To create a project, please run:

```shell
saleor project create
```
