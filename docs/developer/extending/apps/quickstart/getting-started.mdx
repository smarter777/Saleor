## Overview

Saleor provides you with a quick way to set up the platform for your business client. Instead of forking the repository or resorting to the web version, you may use the command-line interface (CLI), which gives you quick access to many actions, like registering an account, logging in or handling your projects and environments from the level of a terminal.

This page guides you through a list of the Saleor CLI commands, alongside their optional parameters for additional behavior. It will get you up and running with your Saleor Cloud instance in no time.

## Prerequisites

To utilize the features of Saleor CLI, you need to be aware of the main concepts that Saleor Cloud is built on.

## Getting Help

Typing `saleor` in the terminal will display a list of possible commands and their descriptions. Typing `saleor <command>` will display additional commands list for this particular command. This way, you can navigate over the interface to trigger specific actions.

## Logging in or Registering

Firstly, you need to login into an existing Saleor Cloud account or create a new one. To log in let's type:

`saleor login`

command, which will redirect you to a webpage with authentication. There, you need to pass in your login credentials. After a successful login, you can come back to the CLI.

To create a new account you need to use:

`saleor register`

and go through the wizard.

## Setting up your organization

As of CLI version 1.13, there is no possibility to create an organization using the command line. Once logged in, use the [Saleor Cloud webpage](https://cloud.saleor.io/) to set up your organization. You can however list, remove and switch between your organizations using the CLI.

## Creating a new Project

After setting up the organization, you are ready to create your first project. In the terminal, type in:

`saleor project create`

After selecting the organization, typing in the name and choosing the region, you'll be set up.

## Creating a new Environment

The last thing to set up is the environment. The setup flow is going to be quite the same as with the previous iterations. In the terminal, use:

`saleor env create`

In the process of establishing the environment, you will be prompted for some details, like the project name, database template or sandbox version. You will also have the possibility to opt-in for dashboard access and basic authorization.

And that's it! You are now ready to use the features of the Saleor Cloud.
