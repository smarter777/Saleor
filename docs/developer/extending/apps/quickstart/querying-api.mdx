title: Querying the Saleor API
---

## Summing up

Arriving here, you should have an application:

- displaying in the Saleor Dashboard
- with a `manifest` updating the information about the `extensions` and `permissions`

## Step 1. Creating example checkouts

Since our application's job is to display a list of abandoned checkouts, we must create some first.

:::note
Checkouts are not created when choosing to populate the database with fictional data in the Saleor Cloud.
:::

To do that, let's head on to the Saleor GraphQL Playground. You can access one that is connected to your Saleor Cloud environment by adding "/graphql" to the end of the instance URL (e.g. "https://example-shop.saleor.cloud/graphql/").

Then, call this mutation a bunch of times with different sets of data:

```graphql
mutation CheckoutCreate {
  checkoutCreate(
    input: {
      channel: "default-channel"
      email: "myname@example.com"
      lines: []
    }
  ) {
    checkout {
      token
    }
    errors {
      field
      code
    }
  }
}
```

## Step 2. Adding the GraphQL query

Our goal is to fetch the abandoned checkouts and display them. Let's focus on the first part for now.

The template the CLI has spawned for us uses [GraphQL Code Generator](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/codegen). If that is the first time you are hearing about it, you may want to take a look at this [article](https://learn.saleor.io/setup/graphql-code-generator/).

What is important for now is that it enables **the creation of TypeScript code out of GraphQL operations**. The code will include the types, as well as hooks needed to execute the operations.

To see it in action, please:

1. Create a `FetchAllCheckouts.graphql` file in the `graphql/queries` folder.
2. Copy and paste the query below:

```jsx
query FetchAllCheckouts {
  checkouts(first: 10) {
    edges {
      node {
        id
        created
        lines {
          variant {
            product {
              name
              thumbnail {
                url
                alt
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

3. Finally, run the following in the terminal:

```shell
pnpm run generate
```

This command will first scan your project for `.graphql` files and then generate code out of them. To make sure everything went fine, you may inspect the newly created `useFetchAllCheckoutsQuery` hook in the `generated/graphql.ts` file.

## Step 3. Building the UI

To render the list of fetched checkouts let's use the Material-UI components, which are pre-installed in the template app. We will present the data in a form of a simple table.

Please go to the `pages` folder, locate the `index.tsx` file, and change its content to:

```tsx
import {
  TableContainer,
  Paper,
  Table,
  TableHead,
  TableRow,
  TableCell,
  TableBody,
} from "@material-ui/core";
import { NextPage } from "next";
import { useFetchAllCheckoutsQuery } from "../../generated/graphql";

const AbandonedCheckoutsPage: NextPage = () => {
  const [{ data, error }] = useFetchAllCheckoutsQuery();

  if (!data?.checkouts) {
    return <div>Loading...</div>;
  }

  if (error) {
    return <div>{error.message}</div>;
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Abandoned Checkouts</h1>

      <main>
        {data?.checkouts.edges.length > 0 ? (
          <TableContainer component={Paper}>
            <Table aria-label="checkouts table">
              <TableHead>
                <TableRow>
                  <TableCell>No.</TableCell>
                  <TableCell>Checkout Id</TableCell>
                  <TableCell>Created At</TableCell>
                </TableRow>
              </TableHead>
              <TableBody>
                {data.checkouts.edges.map((row, i) => (
                  <TableRow key={row.node.id}>
                    <TableCell>{i + 1}.</TableCell>
                    <TableCell>{row.node.id}</TableCell>
                    <TableCell>{row.node.created}</TableCell>
                  </TableRow>
                ))}
              </TableBody>
            </Table>
          </TableContainer>
        ) : (
          <div>No data to display...</div>
        )}
      </main>
    </div>
  );
};

export default AbandonedCheckoutsPage;
```

In the above code, we utilized `useFetchAllCheckoutsQuery()` to pull data from Saleor. Then, we created a table with three columns: `No.`, `Checkout Id` and `Created At`, and iterated over the nodes to display the data in each row.

After adding the necessary imports, the page is ready to be inspected. Go to your Saleor Dashboard and in the _Orders_ tab click on the _Abandoned Checkouts_ label. You should see the table with the data:

![Abandoned Checkouts. Table with data.](../../../screenshots/apps-quickstart/checkouts-list.png)

Congratulations üëè. You have built a complete Saleor app.

There are no criteria for when a use case is complex enough to build an app. One app may be a behemoth with many responsibilities, and another can be simple and focused.

If you want to keep building but are lacking inspiration, I suggest visiting the [App Examples](developer/extending/apps/developing-apps/app-examples.mdx) and our [integrations page](https://saleor.io/integrations/).
