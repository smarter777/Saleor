title: Developing apps with tunnels
---

Saleor apps can be developed fully locally or using Saleor deployed to the cloud (either Saleor Cloud or a self-hosted instance on the internet).

This article describes developing apps using tunneling.

## How does it work

Saleor must communicate with your app, but it can't reach your localhost. Tunneling software creates a proxy,
allowing access to a specific port from localhost to a publically accessible URL

<!-- Consider diagram -->

## Available tunnels

- [Saleor App Tunnel](#saleor-app-tunnel) - official tunnel maintained by Saleor, built into Saleor CLI
- [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) - popular tunnelling software with free plans

You can also look into [alternatives](https://github.com/anderspitman/awesome-tunneling)

## Using tunnels

Tunneling software exposes an app running on localhost on a specific port. Before you start, make sure the dev server is on.

Typically, running the Next.js app in development mode, `next dev` will open the app on `localhost:3000`.

### Saleor App Tunnel

To use a tunnel, you must have installed [Saleor CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@saleor/cli).

:::note
Run `saleor app tunnel -h` to check detailed usage.
:::

To create a tunnel, run `saleor app tunnel`. After several seconds, CLI should print the URL with the`.saleor.live` domain:

```bash
$ saleor app tunnel

✔ Organization · YourShop
✔ Select Environment · staging
✔ Environment · staging
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

     Saleor App Name: Your app
     Saleor App URL: https://your-app-shop.saleor.live

     Saleor Dashboard: https://yourshop.eu.saleor.cloud/dashboard/
     GraphQL Playground: https://yourshop.eu.saleor.cloud/graphql/

─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
✔ Installing...

Tunnel is listening to your local machine on port: 3000

Press CTRL-C to stop the tunnel
Use it to install the app in the Dashboard

```

#### Tunnel & automatic install

Saleor App Tunnel can automatically install the app in the dashboard. Run `saleor app tunnel --force-install` to do that

### Ngrok

Saleor doesn't care what tunnel is used. While App Tunnel from Saleor CLI is extra powerful and can install apps automatically,
you can use an alternative like Ngrok. Most likely, it will be more stable and faster than App Tunnel.

Visit the official [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) documentation to check how to set it up.
Eventually, you will run something like `ngrok http 3000,` and Saleor will be able to access your app.

## Troubleshooting

### Saleor App Tunnel is not working

Saleor Team tries its best to maintain App Tunnel, but we can't promise it will always work.

It's possible that the tunnel hangs or crashes for some reason.

Please report an issue [here](https://github.com/saleor/saleor-cli/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug,tunnel&template=cli-bug-report.md&title=)
and use an alternative like [ngrok](#ngrok) in the meantime.
