title: Developing apps with tunnels
---

Saleor apps can be developed fully locally or using Saleor deployed to the cloud (either Saleor Cloud or a self-hosted instance on the internet).

This article describes developing apps using tunnelling.

## How does it work

Saleor must communicate with your app, but it can't reach your localhost. Tunnelling software creates a proxy,
allowing access to a specific port from localhost to a publically accessible URL

<!-- Consider diagram -->

## Available tunnels

- [Saleor App Tunnel](#saleor-app-tunnel) - official tunnel maintained by Saleor, built into Saleor CLI
- [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) - popular tunnelling software with free plans

You can also look into [alternatives](https://github.com/anderspitman/awesome-tunneling)

## Using tunnels

Tunnelling software is exposing an app running on localhost on a specific ports. Before you run it, ensure your app runs.

Typically, running Next.js app in development mode, `next dev` will open the app on `localhost:3000`

### Saleor App Tunnel

To use a tunnel, you must have installed [Saleor CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@saleor/cli)

:::note
Run `saleor app tunnel -h` to check detailed usage
:::

To create a tunnel, run `saleor app tunnel`. After several seconds, CLI should print the URL with `.saleor.live` domain.
Use it to install the app in the Dashboard

#### Tunnel & automatic install

Saleor App Tunnel can automatically install app in the dashboard. Run `saleor app tunnel --force-install` to do that

### Ngrok

Saleor doesn't care what tunnel is used. While App Tunnel from Saleor CLI is extra powerful and can install apps automatically,
you can use the alternative like Ngrok. Most likely it will be more stable and faster than App Tunnel.

Visit the official [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) documentation to check how to set it up.
Eventually you will run something like `ngrok http 3000` and Saleor will be able to access your app

## Troubleshooting

### Saleor App Tunnel not working

Saleor Team tries it's best to maintain App Tunnel, but we can't promise it will work all the time

It's possible that tunnel hangs or crashes for some reason.

Please report an issue [here](https://github.com/saleor/saleor-cli/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug,tunnel&template=cli-bug-report.md&title=)
and use alternative like [ngrok](#ngrok) in the meantime
