Using the Saleor App is the fastest way of extending Saleor with custom logic. To start App development use [Saleor App Template](https://github.com/saleor/saleor-app-template) as a reference point. It is the boilerplate for writing Saleor Apps with Next.js.

:::tip

Saleor App can be written in any programming language as long as it's a Web application conforming to [requirements](architecture/app-requirements)

:::

The simplest way is to use [Saleor CLI](/cli.mdx) create your first Saleor App.

```bash
saleor app create my-saleor-app
```

or

with `npx`

```bash
npx saleor app create my-saleor-app
```

CLI clones the [Saleor App Template](https://github.com/saleor/saleor-app-template) repository and installs dependencies. Saleor recommends using [Saleor CLI](/cli.mdx) as it provides more commands for the App development which may be useful with the journey with Apps.

While the process is done `cd` the App folder and start the App

```bash
cd my-saleor-app
pnpm dev
```

:::info
To work with the `saleor-app-template` repository, you need to install [`pnpm`](https://pnpm.io/). If you haven't already, please do so by running:

```bash
npm install -g pnpm
```

:::

That's it! Your app should be up and running.
