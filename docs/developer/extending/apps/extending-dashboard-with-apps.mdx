## Key concepts

App extensions allow applications to alter the dashboard's interface by contributing custom buttons, menu items, screens, and modal overlays. It's a convenient way to add new features and capabilities without having to maintain a custom fork of the dashboard application.

All contributed views are embedded inside an `<iframe>` to protect against XSS attacks.

## Manifest

A single App can provide multiple extensions. Each extension is added by specifying it in the app's manifest.
The example manifest below defines two extensions, one providing a custom product action that opens a modal overlay, and a second one providing an alternative product creation page:

```json
{
  ...
  "extensions": [
      {
        "label": "Create with Sample app",
        "mount": "PRODUCT_DETAILS_MORE_ACTIONS",
        "target": "POPUP",
        "permissions": [
            "MANAGE_PRODUCTS"
        ],
        "url": "https://example.com/extension/"
      },
      {
        "label": "Create with App and redirect",
        "mount": "PRODUCT_OVERVIEW_CREATE",
        "target": "APP_PAGE",
        "permissions": [
            "MANAGE_PRODUCTS"
        ],
        "url": "/extension/redirect"
      }
    ],
}
```

- `label`: name which will be displayed in the dashboard
- `mount`: the place where the extension will be mounted
- `target`: method of presenting the interface (defaults to `POPUP`);
  `POPUP` will present the interface in a modal overlay, `APP_PAGE` will navigate to the application page
- `url`: URL of the view to display; you can skip the domain and protocol when `target` is set to `APP_PAGE`, or when your manifest defines an `appUrl`.
  When `target` is set to `POPUP`, the `url` will be used to render an `<iframe>`.

## Possible mounting places

Saleor requires extensions to define a mounting place. The table below explains all mounting locations currently supported by Saleor.
