title: Subscription Webhook Payloads
---

:::note
Subscription Webhook Payloads for **asynchronous** events are available in Saleor **3.2**.

Subscription Webhook payloads for **synchronous** events are available in Saleor **3.6**.
:::

:::caution
This feature is currently in **Feature Preview**. This part of Saleor is not complete
and subject to change but is available to experiment and provide feedback.

## Custom payloads

Webhook payloads in Saleor can be defined with GraphQL subscriptions. Subscription queries allow you to subscribe to different events, and for each one, define what fields should be returned in the payload.

## Building subscription query

To build a subscription query you can use any GraphQL interface (like [GraphQL Playground](developer/getting-started/playground.mdx)). Just like with
building a GraphQL query you will be able to use prompts and build the whole subscription from our API. Payload generation will use resolvers/permissions that are normally used in our API.
Inside the query, you must define the event type for which the payload will be generated. The event type must be supported by our subscription mechanism (see the [list of supported events](developer/api-reference/unions/event.mdx)).

:::warning
When defining subscription payload for synchronous webhooks some fields are blocked to prevent circular calls.
More info on which fields are not allowed can be found in Synchro0nous
:::

The example below is a subscription query that would enable listening to the `PRODUCT_UPDATED` event and requesting the products id and name in the webhook payload:

```graphql
subscription {
  event {
    ... on ProductUpdated {
      product {
        id
        name
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Creating webhook with subscription query

To create a webhook that will have its payload generated using subscription you need to use the same mutation as with standard webhooks. The only difference is passing `query` field as an input with subscription query converted to string.
Webhook with `query` field defined will be treated as a subscription webhook and its payload will be generated from subscription query.

Example **asynchronous** webhook create mutation for subscription payload:

```graphql
mutation {
  webhookCreate(
    input: {
      app: "<app_id>"
      name: "test_product_updated_subscription"
      targetUrl: "<webhook_url>"
      asyncEvents: [PRODUCT_UPDATED]
      query: "subscription{event{...on ProductUpdated{product{id name}}}}"
    }
  ) {
    errors {
      field
      message
    }
    webhook {
      id
    }
  }
}
```

Example **asynchronous** webhook payload:

```json
{
  "product": {
    "id": "UHJvZHVjdDo3Ng==",
    "name": "Coconut Juice"
  }
}
```

Example **synchronous** webhook create mutation for subscription payload:

```graphql
mutation {
  webhookCreate(
    input: {
      app: "<app_id>"
      name: "test_payment_capture_subscription"
      targetUrl: "<webhook_url>"
      syncEvents: [PAYMENT_CAPTURE]
      query: "subscription{event{...on PaymentCaptureEvent{payment{id created}}}}"
    }
  ) {
    errors {
      field
      message
    }
    webhook {
      id
    }
  }
}
```

Example **synchronous** webhook payload:

```json
{
  "payment": {
    "id": "UGF5bWVudDoyNDE=",
    "created": "2022-08-03T08:52:04.202449+00:00"
  }
}
```

## Synchronous webhooks payload

Defining synchronous webhooks payloads using subscriptions is also supported. Each event subscription type has access to its specific objects fields.
Keep in mind that some fields that are using synchronous event to be resolved are not allowed to be called in synchronous webhook payload subscriptions.

# Blocked fields for subscription payloads

Synchronous events are not allowed to request fields that are resolved using other synchronous events, which would lead to circular calls of the webhook.
Fields that are currently unallowed:

| Object     | Fields                                                                    |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Checkout` | `shippingMethods`, `availableShippingMethods`, `availablePaymentGateways` |
| `Order`    | `shippingMethods`, `availableShippingMethods`                             |

## Permissions

Since subscriptions use Saleor API to define webhook payload, the App that has the webhook subscribed needs all the permissions that would normally be required when querying for specified data. Otherwise, payload will not be resolved correctly.
