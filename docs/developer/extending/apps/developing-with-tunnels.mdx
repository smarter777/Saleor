title: Tunneling Apps

## What is a tunnel?

The Saleor extendability model relies on the concept of Apps. If you want to read more about them, head to [the Apps page](developer/key-concepts.mdx).

As you want Apps to react to events in your store, you reach for webhooks. However, webhooks pose a unique challenge: they can only communicate with HTTPS clients. It is a reasonable requirement for a deployed application, but what about the development environment?

This is where tunnels come into play. **A tunnel allows you to create a proxy that exposes a local environment to a public URL.**

        e

Let's say you are building a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) application that leverages a webhook. You boot it up with the `next dev` command, which renders it on `http://localhost:3000`. Since this address is not HTTPS-compliant, the app cannot access the webhook response. We have a perfect use case for a tunnel on our hands.

A simplified process of using a tunnel to expose this app would look like this:

1. You authenticate yourself in the tunneling service of your choosing (e.g.: `ngrok`).
2. You provide the tunnel with the port number `3000` (where your app is running).
3. You access the URL returned from the tunnel.
4. You successfully access the response from the webhook ðŸŽ‰.
