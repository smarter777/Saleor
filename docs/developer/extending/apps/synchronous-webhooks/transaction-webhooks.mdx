title: Transaction webhooks
---

# Introduction

:::caution
This feature is currently in **Feature Preview**. This part of Saleor is not complete
and subject to change but is available to experiment and provide feedback.
:::

Transaction webhooks are synchronous webhooks that allow delegating the transaction's action to the Saleor App.
Synchronous means that these webhooks expect a response of a particular shape to be returned from the App to continue processing in Saleor.
Transaction webhooks only support the HTTP(S) protocol; they are sent as POST requests with the `application/json` body and expect the
response of the same content type.

## Key concepts

The `HANDLE_PAYMENTS` permission is required for the App to receive transaction webhooks.
The webhook notification is only sent to a specific app connected to a given transaction.

The usage of the webhook is strictly related to the payment flow handled by transactions.
You can find more details about the transaction flow in the [_Payments_ documentation](../../../payments#saleor-app-recommended).

## Transaction charge

`TRANSACTION_CHARGE_REQUESTED`

:::info

This feature was introduced in **Saleor 3.13**.

:::

A synchronous webhook called inside a Celery task. It is triggered when a staff user requests the charge action.

The webhook expects to return at least the `pspReference` in the response. The `pspReference` will be attached to [TransactionEvent](api-reference/payments/objects/transaction-event.mdx)
with request details. When `pspReference` is attached to the `request` object, it means the app has successfully processed the webhook.

Optionally the result data can be provided. The data is
used to provide the final status of the requested action, and it will be used to create a new [TransactionEvent](api-reference/payments/objects/transaction-event.mdx)
object. The new [TransactionEvent](../../../../api-reference/payments/objects/transaction-event.mdx) object will have provided `pspReference`, and will be used in the
[recalculation of the transaction's amount process](../../../payments#re-calculations-of-transaction-amounts).

### Request

Saleor will send a
[TRANSACTION_CHARGE_REQUESTED](../../../../api-reference/webhooks/enums/webhook-event-type-sync-enum#code-style-fontweight-normal-webhookeventtypesyncenumbtransaction_charge_requestedbcode)
webhook by using the [TransactionChargeRequested](../../../../api-reference/miscellaneous/objects/transaction-charge-requested) subscription type or with a pre-defined payload in case of a missing subscription query.

You can find more details about building webhook subscription query
[here](../../../extending/apps/subscription-webhook-payloads).

The example below shows a sample webhook subscription defined to handle charge requests:

```graphql
subscription {
  event {
    __typename
    ... on TransactionChargeRequested {
      action {
        actionType
        amount
      }
      transaction {
        id
        pspReference
        authorizedAmount {
          amount
          currency
        }
        order {
          id
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The example below shows the pre-defined payload that will be used in the case when a subscription query is not provided:

```json
{
  "action": { "currency": "USD", "type": "charge", "value": "5.00" },
  "meta": {
    "issued_at": "1914-06-28T10:50:00+00:00",
    "issuing_principal": { "id": "Sample app objects", "type": "app" },
    "version": "3.13.0-a"
  },
  "transaction": {
    "authorized_value": "10.00",
    "available_actions": ["capture", "void"],
    "canceled_value": "0.00",
    "charged_value": "0.00",
    "checkout_id": null,
    "created_at": "1914-06-28T10:50:00Z",
    "currency": "USD",
    "message": "",
    "modified_at": "1914-06-28T10:50:00Z",
    "name": "Credit card",
    "order_id": "T3JkZXI6YjE1YzdlZTgtMzUxNy00MTczLWEzNWYtMmQxMDdkMWI4Yzhk",
    "psp_reference": "PSP ref",
    "reference": "PSP ref",
    "refunded_value": "0.00",
    "status": "Authorized",
    "type": "Credit card",
    "voided_value": "0.00"
  }
}
```

### Response

#### Async flow

App needs to at least return the `pspReference` of the requested action. This is a common case
when the payment provider doesn't return a status of the requested action in the response.
In this situation, the status of the action is delivered by an asynchronous notification that
should be handled by App, and passed to Saleor by using the
[transactionEventReport](../../../payments#reporting-action-for-transaction)
mutation.

The response in this case should have bellowed structure:

```json
{
  "pspReference": "<psp reference received from payment provider>"
}
```

#### Sync flow

The app has the possibility to report the status of the requested action immediately.
This is a common case when the payment provider returns the status of the action in
response to the requested action.
The payload response has to contain at least `pspReference`, `result` (
[CHARGE_SUCCESS](../../../../api-reference/payments/enums/transaction-event-type-enum#code-style-fontweight-normal-transactioneventtypeenumbcharge_successbcode)
or [CHARGE_FAILURE](../../../../api-reference/payments/enums/transaction-event-type-enum#code-style-fontweight-normal-transactioneventtypeenumbcharge_failurebcode)),
and `amount` fields.

The response, in this case, should have bellowed structure:

```json
{
  "pspReference": "<psp reference recieved from payment provider>",
  "result": "<CHARGE_SUCCESS or CHARGE_FAILURE>",
  "amount": "<Decimal amount of the processed action>",
  "time": "<[Optional] time of the action>",
  "externalUrl": "<[Optional] external url with action details.",
  "message": "<[Optional] message related to the action."
}
```

:::caution
In the case when one of `result`, `amount` is provided and the second one is missing,
the response will not be processed, and Saleor will create the failure event.
:::

## Transaction cancelation

`TRANSACTION_CANCELATION_REQUESTED`

:::info

This feature was introduced in **Saleor 3.13**.

:::

A synchronous webhook called inside a Celery task. They are called when a staff user requests the cancelation action.
The webhook expects to return at least the `pspReference` in the response. The `pspReference` will
be attached to [TransactionEvent](api-reference/payments/objects/transaction-event.mdx)
with request details. When `pspReference` is attached to the `request` object, it means the app has successfully processed the webhook. Optionally the result data can be provided. The data is
used to provide the final status of the requested action, and it will be used to create a new
[TransactionEvent](api-reference/payments/objects/transaction-event.mdx) object. The new
[TransactionEvent](../../../../api-reference/payments/objects/transaction-event.mdx) object will have
provided `pspReference`, and will be used in the
[recalculation of the transaction's amount process](../../../payments#re-calculations-of-transaction-amounts).

### Request

Saleor will send a
[TRANSACTION_CANCEL_REQUESTED](../../../../api-reference/webhooks/enums/webhook-event-type-sync-enum#code-style-fontweight-normal-webhookeventtypesyncenumbtransaction_cancelation_requestedbcode)
webhook by using the [TransactionCancelationRequested](../../../../api-reference/miscellaneous/objects/transaction-cancelation-requested) subscription type or with a pre-defined payload in case of a missing subscription query.
You can find more details about building webhook subscription query
[here](../../../extending/apps/subscription-webhook-payloads).

The example below shows a sample webhook subscription defined to handle cancelation requests:

```graphql
subscription {
  event {
    __typename
    ... on TransactionCancelationRequested {
      action {
        actionType
        amount
      }
      transaction {
        id
        pspReference
        authorizedAmount {
          amount
          currency
        }
        order {
          id
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The example below shows the pre-defined payload that will be used in the case when a subscription query is not provided:

```json
{
  "action": { "currency": "USD", "type": "cancel", "value": "0.00" },
