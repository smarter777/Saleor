title: Synchronous Webhooks
---

## Introduction

Synchronous webhooks can be used for extending Saleor without the need to deploy plugins on the API server.

:::warning
Adding synchronous webhooks will affect Saleor API response time. Make sure that the App server can keep up with customer's requests.
:::

These webhooks are run from the Saleor Core instance during GraphQL requests. As a result, the response data is sent to the client.

## Webhook protocol

Synchronous webhooks support only HTTP(S).

Webhook payloads are sent in POST requests.

### Headers

During HTTPS requests there are several headers included:

- `Saleor-Event` - defines the event which is assigned to the webhook
- `Saleor-Domain` - defines Saleor domain
- `Saleor-Signature` - defines the signature to indicate that the request is verifiable

### Payload signature

Saleor calculates the payload signature under `Saleor-Signature`:

- if `secretKey` was set for a webhook - the HMAC SHA-256 header based on it and the payload
- if `secretKey` wasn't set for a webhook - the JWS signature using RS256 with payload detached. To verify the signature you can use a public key, which can be fetched from `http(s)://<your-backend-domain>/.well-known/jwks.json` (available since Saleor 3.5, before 3.5 payloads from webhooks without `secretKey` set were not signed)
