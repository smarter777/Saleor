title: Synchronous Webhooks
---

## Introduction

Synchronous webhooks can be used for extending Saleor without the need to deploy plugins on the API server.

:::warning
Adding synchronous webhooks will affect Saleor API response time. Make sure that the App server can keep up with customer's requests.
:::

These webhooks are run from the Saleor Core instance during GraphQL requests and response data will be passed to the client.

## Webhook protocol

Synchronous webhooks supports only HTTP(S).

Webhook payloads are sent in POST requests.

### Headers

During HTTPS requests there are several headers included:

- `Saleor-Event` - defines event which is assigned to the webhook
- `Saleor-Domain` - defines saleor domain
- `Saleor-Signature` - defines signature to indicate that the request is verifiable

### Payload signature

Saleor calculates a payload signature under `Saleor-Signature`:

- if `secretKey` was set for a webhook - the HMAC SHA-256 header based on it and the payload
- if `secretKey` wasn't set for a webhook - the JWS signature using RS256 with payload detached, to verify signature you can use public key, which can be fetched from `http(s)://<your-backend-domain>/.well-known/jwks.json` (available since Saleor 3.5, before 3.5 payload from webhooks without `secretKey` set were not signed)
