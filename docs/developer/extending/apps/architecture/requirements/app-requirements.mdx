title: App requirements
---

We recommend using [Saleor App Template](developer/extending/apps/developing-apps/app-template.mdx) as a starting point for building your app. It provides all the necessary boilerplate needed to focus on your app's logic.

If you want to build your app from scratch, you should know that to make it installable in the Dashboard, the app must follow certain requirements.

## Requirements

To make your app installable in Saleor Dashboard, please follow these guides:

- [Implement required endpoints](./required-endpoints.mdx)
