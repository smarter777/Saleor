# Taxes

## Overview

_Taxes_ is a Saleor app that allows delegating tax calculations to external tax providers. Here are the currently available providers:

- TaxJar
- Avatax
- Avatax Excise [_coming soon_]

Taxes App has two views: **Channels** and **Providers**.

**Channels** allows you to fill in the "ship from" address and assign a tax provider instance to the channel.

**Providers** allows you to manage the tax provider instances. You can have multiple instances of the same provider.

## Configuration

### Channels

For a channel to appear on the _Channels_ list, you must first select **"use tax app"** as its tax calculation method. You can do that on the _Tax Configuration_ page (_Configuration_ → _Taxes_).

In the _Taxes_ page, select the channel and change the value of _Select the method of tax calculation_ to "_Use tax app_". Then, click _Save_ and come back to the Taxes App.

The channel should now appear on the _Channels_ list. You can now fill in the "ship from" address and assign a tax provider instance to the channel (once you create it in the next step).

### Providers

In the _Providers_ tab, you can create a new tax provider instance. Each tax provider instance is a different set of credentials for a specific tax provider.

To create a new instance, click the tax provider button to see the provider configuration form.

Here are the required fields for each provider:

#### TaxJar
