# Saleor App Store

## What is Saleor App Store?

Saleor App Store is the official extension marketplace for Saleor. It is a view accessible from the Saleor Dashboard that provides an installable collection of [apps](developer/extending/apps/key-concepts.mdx). Each app brings new functionality to Saleor, often by integrating with third-party services.

## Setup

### Saleor Cloud

Each Saleor Cloud instance using version 3.x or higher has access to the Saleor App Store. You can visit it by clicking the _Apps_ tab in the menu.

### Self-hosted

Each Saleor Dashboard using version 3.x or higher has access to the Saleor App Store. You can visit it by clicking the _Apps_ tab in the menu.

In the self-hosted Saleor App Store, the apps are read-only. You can't install them by clicking the _Install_ button on the app card. However, the code for all the apps is available in the [saleor/apps](https://github.com/saleor/apps) repository. You can install them manually by following the instructions:

1. Clone or fork the [saleor/apps](https://github.com/saleor/apps) repository. If you fork it, please make sure you read the [_Forking_ guide](https://github.com/saleor/apps/blob/main/docs/forking.md).
2. For local development, run the app and [tunnel it](developer/extending/apps/developing-with-tunnels.mdx). For production, build the app and deploy it.
3. Click _Install external app_ in the top right corner of the Saleor App Store.
4. Provide the [App Manifest](developer/extending/apps/manifest.mdx) URL. It's your application URL with the "/api/manifest" suffix. For example, if you deployed your app to `https://my-app.com`, the manifest URL is `https://my-app.com/api/manifest`.

## Usage

Saleor App Store consists of two sections:

- Installed Apps - a list of apps that are currently installed on your instance
- All Apps - a list of all apps available in the App Store

Clicking the _Install_ button on any app card will trigger the installation process. It consists of one step: confirming the required app permissions. After confirming the permissions, the app will appear in the _Installed Apps_ section.

If you want to deactivate or delete an app, click on the _Details_ button next to the app name in the _Installed Apps_ section. You can manage your app from there.

An app may require additional configuration (f.e. API key from a service it integrates with). Each app has its own documentation page which contains the configuration instructions.

You can find the list of all the available apps and their documentation in the next chapter ➡️.
