## Creating a new app

To create a new app, use the `appCreate` mutation. This mutation is only available to staff users with the `MANAGE_APPS` permission. Staff user can't grant app more permissions than he has for his own. The mutation takes the following input fields:

- `name`: the name of the app.
- `isActive`: whether to activate the app, defaults to `true`.
- `permissions`: list of permissions the app should be granted.

Let's assume that we want to create an order processing service that can fetch and manage orders in Saleor. To do so, we create a new app with the `MANAGE_ORDERS` permission:

```graphql {2-4}
mutation {
  appCreate(
    input: { name: "Order processing service", permissions: [MANAGE_ORDERS] }
  ) {
    authToken
    app {
      id
      name
    }
    appErrors {
      field
      code
    }
  }
}
```

If there are no errors in the response, a new app is created:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "appCreate": {
      "authToken": "Es1O0oB2O3PTeG9A4IVYUcaMoru3Ls",
      "app": {
        "id": "QXBwOjk=",
        "name": "Order processing service"
      },
      "appErrors": []
    }
  }
}
```

The response contains the `authToken` field - this is the token that the app needs to include in requests to Saleor API to authorize itself and have access to queries or mutations that it needs.

:::note
The `authToken` field is only available in the mutation response and cannot be fetched later, except for the last four digits.

### App authentication

Saleor API for apps uses a bearer token.
To avoid sending passwords with each request, you need to first create a token, and then include it as a header with every GraphQL request.

The authorization header for apps has the following format:

```http
Authorization: Bearer <app-token>
```

## Creating authorization keys

Creating an app with `appCreate` mutation creates the default authorization token (`authToken`). You can create more authorization keys with the `appTokenCreate`. The mutation takes the following fields:

- `app`: ID of the app.
- `name`: (optional) name of the key.

```graphql {2-4}
mutation {
  appTokenCreate(
    input: { app: "QXBwOjk=" }
  ) {
    authToken
    appErrors {
      field
      code
    }
    appToken {
      id
    }
  }
}
```

## Revoking authorization keys

To revoke an authorization key, use the `appTokenDelete`:

```graphql
mutation {
  appTokenDelete(id: "QXBwOjk=") {
    appErrors {
      field
      code
  }
}
```

## Webhooks

Webhooks can be used to receive data from Saleor when particular events happen. The available events are:

| Name                        | Description                                                                                                                      |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ANY_EVENTS`                | Receive webhooks when any of the available events is triggered (wildcard event).                                                 |

| `CUSTOMER_CREATED`          | A new customer account is created.                                                                                               |
| `ORDER_CREATED`             | A new order is placed.                                                                                                           |
| `ORDER_FULLY_PAID`          | Payment is made and an order is fully paid.                                                                                      |
| `ORDER_UPDATED`             | An order is updated; triggered for all changes related to an order; covers all other order webhooks, except for `ORDER_CREATED`. |
| `ORDER_CANCELLED`           | An order is cancelled.                                                                                                           |

### Webhook protocols

Webhooks support below protocols:

- HTTP(S) 
- Google Cloud Pub/Sub
- AWS SQS

#### HTTP(S)

Webhook payloads are sent in POST requests.

All webhooks with `targetUrl`, where the scheme is HTTP(S) will use this protocol.

Saleor calculates the HMAC sha256 header - `X-Saleor-Signature` based on `secretKey` and the payload


#### Google Cloud Pub/Sub

All webhooks where scheme is `gcpubsub` will be treated as a Google Cloud Pub/Sub webhooks.
The structure of `targetUrl` should be as below:
```
gcpubsub://cloud.google.com/projects/<yourproject>/topics/<yourtopic>
```

To proper use the google cloud pub/sub you need to set the [`GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/quickstart-client-libraries) 


#### AWS SQS

All webhooks where scheme is `awssqs` will be treated as aws sqs webhooks.

The structure of `targetUrl` should be as below:
```
awssqs://<access_key_id>:<secret_access_key>@sqs.<region>.amazonaws.com/<account_id>/<queue_name>
```


### Subscribing to a webhook

To subscribe to a webhook, we need to first create an app with proper permissions. Let's assume that we want to extend the order processing app that we've created in the example above. The app should receive notifications whenever new orders are created in Saleor. To do so, we'll create a new webhook using the `webhookCreate` mutation. The mutation takes the following input:

- `name`: name of the webhook.
- `targetUrl`: URL of a service that will receive webhooks requests.
- `events`: list of the events to subscribe to.
- `app`: ID of the app to which the webhook belongs.
- `isActive`: whether to activate the webhook.

```graphql
mutation {
  webhookCreate(
    input: {
      name: "New orders notification"
      targetUrl: "https://order-processing-service.example.com"
      events: [ORDER_CREATED]
      app: "QXBwOjk="
      isActive: true
      secretKey: "secret-key"
    }
  ) {
    webhook {
      id
    }
    webhookErrors {
      field
      code
    }
  }
}
```

If there are no errors in the response, the webhook is successfully created. From now on, whenever a new order is placed, payload with order data will be sent to your `targetUrl`.

### Updating a webhook

To update a webhook (e.g. to deactivate it or change the permissions), use the `webhookUpdate` mutation. The mutation takes similar input fields as the `webhookCreate` mutation. The example below shows how to deactive a webhook:

```graphql
mutation {
  webhookUpdate(id: "V2ViaG9vazox", input: { isActive: false }) {
    webhook {
      isActive
    }
    webhookErrors {
      field
      code
    }
  }
}
```

### Removing a webhook

To fully remove a webhook, use the `webhookDelete` mutation:

```graphql
mutation {
  webhookDelete(id: "V2ViaG9vazox") {
    webhookErrors {
      field
      code
    }
  }
}
```
