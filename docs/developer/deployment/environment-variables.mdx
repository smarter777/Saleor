title: Environment Variables
---

We are fans of the [12 factor](https://12factor.net/) approach and portable code, so you can configure most of Saleor using only environment variables.

## General Configuration

### `ALLOWED_CLIENT_HOSTS`

A list of strings representing host/domain names of client applications (storefront or dashboard) that use this Saleor instance as a backend. Values in this list should be URLs in [RFC 1808](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1808) format.

Some operations, such as registering a new account or resetting the password, involve sending an email from the backend with a link that users need to click to confirm the action. The backend doesn't know the structure of frontend applications' routing and the path to the view where users can proceed with the operation needs to be passed as arguments in GraphQL mutations. These paths are validated against URLs configured in the `ALLOWED_CLIENT_HOSTS` setting.

When `ALLOWED_CLIENT_HOSTS` is empty, the paths are validated against `localhost, 127.0.0.1`.

Multiple values should be separated with a comma.

### `ALLOWED_HOSTS`

This variable controls [Django’s allowed hosts](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/ref/settings/#allowed-hosts) setting. It defaults to `localhost`.

Multiple values should be separated with a comma.

### `CACHE_URL` or `REDIS_URL`

The URL of a cache database. It defaults to local process memory.

Use of Redis is recommended. Heroku’s Redis will export this setting automatically.

**Example**: `redis://redis.example.com:6379/0`

### `DATABASE_URL`

This variable defaults to a local PostgreSQL instance. See [Using Docker for Development](getting-started/docker.md) for how to get a local database running inside a Docker container.

Most Heroku databases will export this settings automatically.

**Example:** `postgres://user:password@psql.example.com/database`

### `DEBUG`

Controls [Django’s debug mode](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/ref/settings/#s-debug). It defaults to `True`.

### `DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL`

Indicates a default email address to use for all outgoing mail.

### `EMAIL_URL`

The URL of the email gateway. Defaults to printing everything to the console.

**Example:** `smtp://user:password@smtp.example.com:465/?ssl=True`

### `INTERNAL_IPS`

Controls [Django’s internal IPs setting](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/ref/settings/#s-internal-ips). Defaults to `127.0.0.1`.

Multiple values should be separated with a comma.

### `SECRET_KEY`

Controls [Django’s secret key](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/ref/settings/#s-secret-key) setting.

### `SENTRY_DSN`

This is Sentry’s [Data Source Name](https://docs.sentry.io/error-reporting/configuration/?platform=python#dsn). It is disabled by default. It allows you to enable integration with Sentry (see [Error tracking with Sentry](deployment/sentry.md) for details).

### `MAX_CART_LINE_QUANTITY`

This variable controls the maximum number of items in one cart line. It defaults to `50`.

### `STATIC_URL`

Controls the production assets mount path. Defaults to `/static/`.

### `DEFAULT_CURRENCY`

Indicates a default currency which is a basis for all prices entered and stored in your store.

### `DEFAULT_COUNTRY`

Indicates the default country of your store. Depending on what setup you require, this variable also controls the default VAT, shipping country, etc.

### `CREATE_IMAGES_ON_DEMAND`

Indicates whether or not new images are created on-the-fly. By default it is set to `True`.
For production, we recommend you set this to `False` to speed the performance.
Make sure all images come with a pre-warm to ensure they’re created and available at the appropriate URL.

To create missing thumbnails for all images use:

```shell
python manage.py create_thumbnails
```

## Tax Configuration

For more information on how to configure taxes in Saleor, see the [taxes](guides/taxes.md) topic of the _How to_ section.

### `VATLAYER_ACCESS_KEY`

Indicates an access key to [vatlayer’s API](https://vatlayer.com/).

### `AVATAX_USERNAME_OR_ACCOUNT`

This variable stores Avalara’s `username` or `account`.

### `AVATAX_PASSWORD_OR_LICENSE`

This variable stores Avalara’s `password` or `license`.

### `AVATAX_USE_SANDBOX`

`True` when `DEBUG` is set to `True`. This variable determines if Saleor should use the Avatax sandbox API.

### `AVATAX_COMPANY_NAME`

Defaults to `DEFAULT`. Avalara needs to receive a company code. Some more complicated systems can use more than one company code; in such cases, this variable should be changed based on data from Avalara’s admin panel.

### `AVATAX_AUTOCOMMIT`

Defaults to `False`. This variable determines if all transactions sent to Avalara should be committed by default.
