_Taxes_ is a Saleor app that allows delegating tax calculations to external tax providers. Here are the currently available providers:

- [TaxJar](https://www.taxjar.com/)
- [Avatax](https://www.avalara.com/us/en/products/calculations.html)
- [Avatax Excise](https://developer.avalara.com/excise/) [_coming soon_]
- [Stripe Tax](https://stripe.com/tax) [_coming soon_]

Taxes App offers flexibility in how you calculate taxes. You can have one provider for all your channels or use different providers for each channel. You can even create multiple configurations of the same provider (f.e. if you have a different account for testing).

:::caution

To successfully configure the Taxes App, you must have an account with one of the supported tax providers.

## Configuration

### Channels

For a channel to appear on the _Channels_ list, you must first select **"use tax app"** as its tax calculation method. You can do that on the _Tax Configuration_ page (_Configuration_ â†’ _Taxes_).

In the _Taxes_ page, select the channel and change the value of _Select the method of tax calculation_ to "_Use tax app_". Then save it and come back to the Taxes App.

### Providers

In the _Providers_ tab, you can manage your tax provider instances. Each tax provider instance is a different set of credentials for a specific tax provider.

You can find instructions for configuring a provider in their individual pages:

- [TaxJar](taxjar)
- [Avatax](avatax)
