_Taxes_ is a Saleor app that allows delegating tax calculations to external tax providers. It can replace the default ([flat rates](docs/developer/taxes.mdx#flat-rates)) tax calculation method in Saleor. It affects both the checkout and the order creation process.

## Configuration

### Channels

For a channel to appear on the _Available channels_ list, you must first select **"use tax app"** as its tax calculation method. You can do that on the _Tax Configuration_ page (_Configuration_ â†’ _Taxes_).

In the _Taxes_ page, select the channel and change the value of _Select the method of tax calculation_ to "_Use tax app_". Then save it and come back to the Taxes App.

### Providers

In the _Tax providers_ section, you can manage your tax provider instances. Each tax provider instance is a different configuration for a specific tax provider.

You can find instructions for configuring providers on their individual pages:

- [TaxJar](taxjar/configuration)
- [Avatax](avatax/configuration)
