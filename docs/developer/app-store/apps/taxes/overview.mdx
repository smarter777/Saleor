_Taxes_ is a Saleor app that allows delegating tax calculations to external tax providers. It currently supports the following providers:

- [TaxJar](https://www.taxjar.com/)
- [Avatax](https://www.avalara.com/us/en/index.html)
- [Avatax Excise](https://developer.avalara.com/excise/) [_coming soon_]
- [Stripe Tax](https://stripe.com/tax) [_coming soon_]

:::caution

To successfully configure the Taxes App, you must have an account with one of the supported tax providers.

## Features

Taxes App can replace the default ([flat rates](docs/developer/taxes.mdx#flat-rates)) tax calculation method in Saleor. It affects both the checkout and the order creation process by operating on the following webhooks:

- [`ORDER_CALCULATE_TAXES`](docs/api-reference/webhooks/enums/webhook-event-type-sync-enum.mdx#code-style-fontweight-normal-webhookeventtypesyncenumborder_calculate_taxesbcode)
- [`CHECKOUT_CALCULATE_TAXES`](docs/api-reference/webhooks/enums/webhook-event-type-sync-enum.mdx#code-style-fontweight-normal-webhookeventtypesyncenumborder_calculate_taxesbcode)
- [`ORDER_CREATED`](docs/api-storefront/webhooks/enums/webhook-sample-event-type-enum.mdx#code-style-fontweight-normal-webhooksampleeventtypeenumborder_createdbcode)
- [`ORDER_FULFILLED`](docs/api-storefront/webhooks/enums/webhook-sample-event-type-enum.mdx#code-style-fontweight-normal-webhooksampleeventtypeenumborder_createdbcode)

Taxes App offers flexibility in how you calculate taxes. You can have one provider for all your channels or use different providers for each channel. You can even create multiple configurations of the same provider (f.e. if you have a different account for testing).

### Tax code matcher

Taxes App offers a solution for mapping the provider tax codes to Saleor tax classes. This assures the products are taxed based on their individual tax rates, not a general one.

To illustrate the feature, imagine you are running a book store that sells comic books.

You first create the "_Comic books_" Saleor tax class (_Configuration_ → _Taxes_ → _Tax classes_ in the Dashboard) and assign it to comic book products or their variants.

In the _Tax code matcher_ section of the Taxes App, you will find your "Comicbook" tax class. You browse the tax codes of your tax provider and assign the correct one to the Saleor tax class. In Avatax, that tax code may be "PB100817 - Comicbooks". The selected tax code will appear on the product line in Avatax when the transaction is created.

## Configuration

### Channels

For a channel to appear on the _Available channels_ list, you must first select **"use tax app"** as its tax calculation method. You can do that on the _Tax Configuration_ page (_Configuration_ → _Taxes_).

In the _Taxes_ page, select the channel and change the value of _Select the method of tax calculation_ to "_Use tax app_". Then save it and come back to the Taxes App.

### Providers

In the _Tax providers_ section, you can manage your tax provider instances. Each tax provider instance is a different configuration for a specific tax provider.

You can find instructions for configuring providers on their individual pages:

- [TaxJar](taxjar)
- [Avatax](avatax)
