# Document recording

Taxes App creates Avatax transactions on two events:

- while calculating taxes (in order or checkout)
- while confirming an order

When calculating taxes, the default [document type](https://developer.avalara.com/avatax/dev-guide/transactions/document-types/) is `SalesOrder`. It makes the transaction temporary and not visible in the Avalara dashboard.

In the case of order confirmation, the default document type is `SalesInvoice`. It makes the transaction permanent and visible in the Avalara dashboard.

The Avatax configuration form in the Taxes App contains _Document recording_ toggle. When switched off, it changes all the document types to `SalesOrder`. This effectively stops the "document recording", making all the transactions temporary.
