# Mapping the entity type

Avatax supports [`entityUseCode`](https://developer.avalara.com/erp-integration-guide/sales-tax-badge/designing/entity-code/) field that represents the type of customer the transaction is assigned to. The field is then used to determine the taxability of the transaction.

Let's say you have a draft order that was filled by tax-exempted US government entity. In Avatax, the code for a "FEDERAL_GOV" entity is "A". To map the entity type, you need to provide the value for the `entityUseCode` field of the Order `metadata` field of key `avataxEntityCode`. We will do it using the `updateMetadata` mutation:

```graphql
mutation UpdatePrivateMetadata {
  updatePrivateMetadata(
    id: "order_id"
    input: { key: "avataxEntityCode", value: "A" }
  ) {
    item {
      metadata {
        key
        value
      }
    }
  }
}
```

When the draft order is finalized, the `avataxEntityCode` metadata field will be copied to the `entityUseCode` field of the Avatax transaction.
