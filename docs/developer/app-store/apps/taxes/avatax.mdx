# Avatax

[Avalara AvaTax](https://www.avalara.com/us/en/index.html) is a cloud-based solution automating transaction tax calculations and the tax filing process. Avalara
provides real-time tax calculation using tax content from more than 12,000 US taxing jurisdictions and over 200
countries, insuring your transaction tax is calculated based on the most current tax rules.

## Features

### Mapping the entity type

By providing the value for the Order metadata field of key `avataxEntityCode`, you can attach [`entityUseCode`](https://developer.avalara.com/erp-integration-guide/sales-tax-badge/designing/entity-code/) to transactions that will be created in Avatax. You can use this feature to, f.e., mark the customers that should be tax-exempted.
