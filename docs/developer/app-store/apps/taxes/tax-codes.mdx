# Mapping tax codes

Taxes App offers a solution for mapping the provider tax codes to Saleor tax classes. This assures the products are taxed based on their individual tax rates, not a general one.

To illustrate the feature, imagine you are running a book store that sells comic books.

You first create the "_Comic books_" Saleor tax class (_Configuration_ → _Taxes_ → _Tax classes_ in the Dashboard) and assign it to comic book products or their variants.

In the _Tax code matcher_ section of the Taxes App, you will find your "Comicbook" tax class. You browse the tax codes of your tax provider and assign the correct one to the Saleor tax class. In AvaTax, that tax code may be "PB100817 - Comicbooks". The selected tax code will appear on the product line in AvaTax when the transaction is created.
