## Introduction

This guide describes how to request for a thumbnail and how the thumbnails are generated.

### Thumbnails sizes and formats

Thumbnails are available on the following models and fields:

- `User.avatar`
- `OrderLine.thumbnail`
- `Product.thumbnail`
- `Collection.background_image`
- `Category.background_image`
- `ProductMedia.url`
- `ProductImage.url`

You can specify the `size` and `format` of a thumbnail. You may pass any integer as `size`,
but we will resolve it to the closest value from the following list:
[32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096].
For example: when you pass "55", we resolve it to "64".

Currently, `WebP` is the only supported value for `format`.
Both `size` and `format` fields are optional, but when you decide to provide `format`,
the `size` becomes required as well. If you don't specify these or pass only one,
the original image attributes will be used.

:::caution
You might meet the problem with the `WebP` content type recognition.
Currently, there is an issue in python with validation of the content type of `WebP` files,
but should be fixed in python 3.11.
Since then, to fix the problem extend one of `mime.types`
[files](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/3.10/Lib/mimetypes.py#L48) with the `image/webp`.

### Generating the thumbnails

The thumbnails are generated on-demand. When the user requests the thumbnail with the
given size and format for the first time, the proxy URL is returned. When the proxy URL
is opened, the requested thumbnail is created and the user gets the requested image.
In case of a second and further request for the same thumbnail, the previously created
thumbnail's URL is returned.

### Example

Here is an example query for the category's background image of `size` = "100" and `format` = "WebP":

```graphql
query {
  category(id: "Q2F0ZWdvcnk6MjU=") {
    name
    backgroundImage(size: 100, format: WEBP) {
      url
      alt
    }
  }
}
```

The query runs for the first time, and as a result, the response contains proxy URL:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "category": {
      "name": "Accessories",
      "backgroundImage": {
        "url": "http://localhost:8000/thumbnail/Q2F0ZWdvcnk6MjU=/128/webp/",
        "alt": ""
      }
    }
  },
  "extensions": {
    "cost": {
      "requestedQueryCost": 1,
      "maximumAvailable": 50000
    }
  }
}
```

After opening the link, the thumbnail with the `size` of "128", and the `format` of "WebP" is generated.
The resolution is equal to 128 as this is the closest available size to the provided value.

The next time we run the query, we receive the URL to the actual thumbnail.

```json
{
  "data": {
    "category": {
      "name": "Accessories",
      "backgroundImage": {
        "url": "http://localhost:8000/media/thumbnails/category-backgrounds/20210809_181533_2240b122_thumbnail_128.webp",
        "alt": ""
      }
    }
  },
  "extensions": {
    "cost": {
      "requestedQueryCost": 1,
      "maximumAvailable": 50000
    }
  }
}
```
