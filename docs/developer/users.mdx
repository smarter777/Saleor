## Introduction

This guide describes how to use the Saleor GraphQL API to register a new account as a customer and do common account management operations.

## Creating a new customer account

Depending on the configuration of your Saleor backend instance, registering a new customer account may be a single-step operation or it may require email confirmation to activate the account (see [`ENABLE_ACCOUNT_CONFIRMATION_BY_EMAIL`](developer/configuration.mdx#enable_account_confirmation_by_email)).

Let's see first how to register a new account without email confirmation.

### Registration without email confirmation

To create a new customer account, use the `accountRegister` mutation. The mutation takes the following input fields:

- `email` - user's email address.
- `password` - user's password.

```graphql
mutation {
  accountRegister(
    input: { email: "customer@example.com", password: "secret" }
  ) {
    accountErrors {
      field
      code
    }
    user {
      email
      isActive
    }
  }
}
```

As a result, we get data of the newly created user:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "accountRegister": {
      "accountErrors": [],
      "user": {
        "email": "customer@example.com",
        "isActive": true
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The `isActive` flag informs that the account is active and the user can log in to their account.

Examples above include `accountErrors` field, which may return any [data-level errors](developer/error-handling.mdx#data-level-errors). Here is a response that would be returned if there is already account registered for the given email:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "accountRegister": {
      "accountErrors": [
        {
          "field": "email",
          "code": "UNIQUE"
        }
      ],
      "user": null
    }
  }
}
```

### Registration with email confirmation

Registering an account with email confirmation consists of two steps and it requires you to have a storefront view, where users will be redirected to confirm their email. First, you need to use the `accountRegister` mutation, which will create an inactive account and send an email with the confirmation link.

The mutation takes the following input fields:

- `email` - user's email address.
- `password` - user's password.
- `redirectUrl` - path to a view where the user should be redirected to confirm their email

This example assumes that you're running the storefront locally with the default settings (running on port `3000`):

```graphql
mutation {
  accountRegister(
    input: {
      email: "customer@example.com"
      password: "secret"
      redirectUrl: "http://localhost:3000/account-confirm/"
    }
  ) {
    accountErrors {
      field
      code
    }
    user {
      email
      isActive
    }
  }
}
```

As a result, we get data of the newly created, but yet inactive user:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "accountRegister": {
      "accountErrors": [],
      "user": {
        "email": "customer@example.com",
        "isActive": false
      }
    }
  }
}
```

At the same time the user `customer@example.com` should receive an email with a confirmation link based on provided `redirectUrl` path, for example:

```
http://localhost:3000/account-confirm/?email=customer%40example.com&token=5fc-9f2116f96bdafd612cf4
```

The link contains two query parameters - `email` and `token` - which are required to proceed with the second mutation, `confirmAccount`:

```graphql
mutation {
  confirmAccount(
    email: "customer@example.com"
    token: "5fc-9f2116f96bdafd612cf4"
  ) {
    accountErrors {
      field
      code
    }
    user {
      email
      isActive
    }
  }
}
```

If the token is valid, the user will be successfully activated:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "confirmAccount": {
      "accountErrors": [],
      "user": {
        "email": "customer@example.com",
        "isActive": true
      }
    }
  }
}
```
