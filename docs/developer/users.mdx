## Introduction

This guide describes how to use the Saleor GraphQL API to register a new account as a customer and do the most common account management operations.

## Creating a new customer account

Depending on the configuration of your Saleor backend instance, registering a new customer account may be a simple, single-step operation or it may require email confirmation to activate the account (see [`ENABLE_ACCOUNT_CONFIRMATION_BY_EMAIL`](developer/configuration.mdx#enable_account_confirmation_by_email)).

Let's see first how to register a new account without email confirmation.

### Registration without email confirmation

To create a new customer account, use the `accountRegister` mutation.

```graphql
mutation {
  accountRegister(
    input: { email: "customer@example.com", password: "secret" }
  ) {
    accountErrors {
      field
      message
      code
    }
    user {
      id
      email
      isActive
    }
  }
}
```

The mutation takes the following input fields:

- `email` - the user's email address.
- `password` - the user's password.

As a result, we get data of the newly created user:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "accountRegister": {
      "accountErrors": [],
      "user": {
        "id": "VXNlcjo1MA==",
        "email": "customer@example.com",
        "isActive": true
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The `isActive` flag informs that the account is active.

Examples above include `accountErrors` field, which may return any data-level errors when, for some reason, the account couldn't be created. Here is a response that you would get if an account with the email provided in the mutation already exists:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "accountRegister": {
      "accountErrors": [
        {
          "field": "email",
          "message": "User with this email already exists.",
          "code": "UNIQUE"
        }
      ],
      "user": null
    }
  }
}
```
