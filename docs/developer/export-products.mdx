## Introduction
This guide describes how to export products from the Saleor GraphQL API.

You can export all products, filtered products, or products with specific ids. 
Products data can be exported to CSV or XLSX file, but CSV file is recommended because
it is much less time-consuming. You can also defined which fields will be exported.
If any product variants fields are specified then products and variants data are exported.

**What is useful for?**
- Creating a backup of your products
- Easy and quick bulk editing of products

## Exporting products
:::note
Products can be exported only by logged users with `MANAGE_PRODUCTS` permission.
:::

To export products, use `exportProducts` mutation.

This mutation takes the following input:
- `scope`:
- `filter`:
- `ids`:
- `fileType`:
- `exportInfo`:

`exportInfo` takes the following input:
- `attributes`:
- `warehouses`:
- `fields`: 

As a result, this mutation returns `ExportFile` object which is a `Job` instance.
It corresponds to running export tasks, keeps task status, and created file.
