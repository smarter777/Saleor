## Introduction
This guide describes how to export products from the Saleor GraphQL API.

You can export all products, filtered products, or products with specific ids. 
Products data can be exported to CSV or XLSX file, but CSV file is recommended because
it is much less time-consuming. You can also defined which fields will be exported.
If any product variants fields are specified then products and variants data are exported.

**What is useful for?**
- Creating a backup of your products
- Easy and quick bulk editing of products

## Exporting products
:::note
Products can be exported only by logged users with `MANAGE_PRODUCTS` permission.
:::

To export products, use `exportProducts` mutation.

This mutation takes the following input:
- `scope`: determine which products should be exported. You can choose between exporting
all products (`ALL`), filtered products (`FILTER`) or selected ids (`IDS`).
You can find more details below.
- `filter`: defines filtering option. This field is optional but must be specified if your
choose `FILTER` scope option.
- `ids`: a list of products ids to export. This field is optional but must be specified
if `IDS` in `scope` is chosen.
- `fileType`: defines exported file type. You can choose between CSV and XLSX file.
- `exportInfo`: determine exported fields. It takes the following input:
    - `attributes`: list of attribute ids to export (optional).
    - `warehouses`: list of warehouse ids to export (optional).
    - `fields`: list of product and variants fields to export
    (optional, `id` field is exported by default).

As a result, this mutation returns `ExportFile` object which is a `Job` instance.
It corresponds to running export tasks, keeps task status, and created file.
`ExportFile` object contains the following fields:
- `id`: a unique export file ID. Could be use to check job status.
- `status`: status of running job.
- `createdBy`: instance of `User` who requested exporting products.
- `createdAt`: the date and time when the job was started.
- `updatedAt`: the date and time when the job was last time updated.
- `url`: URL to the exported file. Set to `null` when the file doesn't exist yet.
- `events`: a list of events associated with the export.

In addition the following field is available on the mutation results:
- `csvErrors`: a list of errors that occurred during mutation execution.

### Exporting all products
The following example shows how to export all products with all available fields
to csv file.

:::note
Fields order defines order of headers in exported file. Exporting any of `price` fields
adding `currency` field be default.

```graphql {2-26}
mutation {
  exportProducts(
    input: {
        scope:ALL,
        fileType: CSV,
        exportInfo: {
            fields: [
                NAME
                DESCRIPTION
                PRODUCT_TYPE
                CATEGORY
                VISIBLE
                COLLECTIONS
                CHARGE_TAXES
                PRICE
                PRODUCT_IMAGES
                VARIANT_SKU
                PRICE_OVERRIDE
                COST_PRICE
                VARIANT_IMAGES
                PRODUCT_WEIGHT
                VARIANT_WEIGHT
            ]
        }
    }
 ){
    exportFile {
      id
      status
      createdAt
      updatedAt
      url
    }
    csvErrors {
      field
      code
      message
    }
  }
}
```

In response we get workers information:
```json
{
  "data": {
    "exportProducts": {
      "exportFile": {
        "id": "RXhwb3J0RmlsZToxMA==",
        "status": "PENDING",
        "createdAt": "2020-06-05T09:15:42.924676+00:00",
        "updatedAt": "2020-06-05T09:16:27.691838+00:00",
        "url": ""
      },
      "csvErrors": []
    }
  }
}
```

When task success finished, you will see `url` field with the URL address to
exported file. Example data below:
```json
{
  "data": {
    "exportProducts": {
      "exportFile": {
        "id": "RXhwb3J0RmlsZToxMA==",
        "status": "PENDING",
        "createdAt": "2020-06-05T09:15:42.924676+00:00",
        "updatedAt": "2020-06-05T09:16:27.691838+00:00",
        "url": "http://localhost:8000/media/export_files/product_data_05_06_2020.csv"
      },
      "csvErrors": []
    }
  }
}
```

### Exporting filtered products
To export only filtered products you need to define `FILTER` `scope` and `filter`
field. Lets see an example for exporting only published products from two specific
categories:

```graphql {2-19}
mutation {
  exportProducts(
    input: {
        scope:ALL,
        fileType: CSV,
        exportInfo: {
            fields: [
                NAME
                DESCRIPTION
                PRODUCT_TYPE
                VARIANT_SKU
            ]
        },
        filter: {
            isPublished: true,
            categories: ["Q2F0ZWdvcnk6Nw==", "Q2F0ZWdvcnk6MjI="]
        }
    }
 ){
    exportFile {
      id
      status
      createdAt
      updatedAt
      url
    }
    csvErrors {
      field
      code
      message
    }
  }
}
```

### Exporting products with specified IDs
To export only products with provided ids you need to define `IDS` `scope` and `ids`
field. Lets see an example:
```graphql {2-19}
mutation {
  exportProducts(
    input: {
        scope:ALL,
        fileType: CSV,
        exportInfo: {
            fields: [
                NAME
                DESCRIPTION
                PRODUCT_TYPE
                VARIANT_SKU
            ]
        },
        filter: {
            isPublished: true,
            categories: ["Q2F0ZWdvcnk6Nw==", "Q2F0ZWdvcnk6MjI="]
        }
    }
 ){
    exportFile {
      id
      status
      createdAt
      updatedAt
      url
    }
    csvErrors {
      field
      code
      message
    }
  }
}
```
