## Introduction

Properly configured attributes provide crucial information about your products and allow users to find the ones they are looking for quicker.

Attributes can be used for
- [Products](developer/api-reference/objects/product.mdx) and [ProductVariants](developer/api-reference/objects/product-variant.mdx)
- [Pages](developer/api-reference/objects/page.mdx)

## Use cases

1. Your store sells mugs in many colors and sizes. In this example, you can configure the following attributes:
- Color attribute (red, black, etc.)
- Size attribute (small, big)

2. Your shop has many pages with different rendering styles. You can create an attribute called `Template` with a `PAGE_TYPE` type. You can set the following values: `Support`, `Blog`, `Promos`. Then you can upload a proper CSS template based on a `Template` value in the storefront code. 

## Permissions

To edit and create attributes, a user needs to have the following permissions:
- `MANAGE_PRODUCT_TYPES_AND_ATTRIBUTES`
- `MANAGE_PAGE_TYPES_AND_ATTRIBUTES`

To assign attributes to products and pages, a user needs only the following permissions: `MANAGE_PRODUCTS` and `MANAGE_PAGES`.

## Filtering by attributes

A user can use a `slug`  to filter products by attributes. The query parameters can be encoded in URL and they will be the same in all languages.

An example of a [`products`](developer/api-reference/queries/products.mdx) query:
```graphql
query {
  products(
    first: 5
    filter: { attributes: [{ slug: "bucket-size", value: "25l" }] }
  ) {
    edges {
      node {
        name
      }
    }
  }
}
```
Response:
```json
{
  "data": {
    "products": {
      "edges": [
        {
          "node": {
            "name": "Hyperspace Turquoise Paint"
          }
        },
        {
          "node": {
            "name": "Light Speed Yellow Paint"
          }
        },
        {
          "node": {
            "name": "Nebula Night Sky Paint"
          }
        },
        {
          "node": {
            "name": "Red Dwarf Red Paint"
          }
        },
        {
          "node": {
            "name": "Space Dust Navy Paint"
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```
