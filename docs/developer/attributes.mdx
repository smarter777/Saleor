## Introduction

Setting up attributes will allow your users to filter your products catalogue.

Attributes can be used for
- [Products](developer/api-reference/objects/product.mdx) and [ProductVariants](developer/api-reference/objects/product-variant.mdx)
- [Pages](developer/api-reference/objects/page.mdx)

## Use cases

1. Your store sells Mugs in many colors and sizes. This means you will need:
- Color attribute (red, black, etc.)
- Size attribute (Small, Big)

2. Your shop has many Pages which should render with different styles. To achieve that, you can create attribute named `Template` with type `PAGE_TYPE`. As values you could set: `Support`, `Blog`, `Promos`. Then in storefront code you could load proper css template based on page `Template` value.

## Permissions

To edit and create Attributes user is required to have permissions:
- `MANAGE_PRODUCT_TYPES_AND_ATTRIBUTES`
- `MANAGE_PAGE_TYPES_AND_ATTRIBUTES`

Assigning Attrubutes to Products and Pages does not require additional permission besides `MANAGE_PRODUCTS` and `MANAGE_PAGES`

## Filtering by attributes

For filtering by attributes you can use their `slug` name. This way you can be sure that query parameters can be encoded in the URL and will be the same in all languages.

Example of [`products`](developer/api-reference/queries/products.mdx) query:
```graphql
query {
  products(
    first: 5
    filter: { attributes: [{ slug: "bucket-size", value: "25l" }] }
  ) {
    edges {
      node {
        name
      }
    }
  }
}
```
Response:
```json
{
  "data": {
    "products": {
      "edges": [
        {
          "node": {
            "name": "Hyperspace Turquoise Paint"
          }
        },
        {
          "node": {
            "name": "Light Speed Yellow Paint"
          }
        },
        {
          "node": {
            "name": "Nebula Night Sky Paint"
          }
        },
        {
          "node": {
            "name": "Red Dwarf Red Paint"
          }
        },
        {
          "node": {
            "name": "Space Dust Navy Paint"
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```
