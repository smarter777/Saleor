title: Stock allocation
---

## Introduction

This guide explains how the allocations are handled in Saleor.

## Glossary

The warehouses, shipping zones, and channels must be linked together
to provide the expected allocation. Below you can find the explanation of the terms
that will be required to properly understand this guide:

- channel - allows configuring your shop differently for different currencies;
  go [here](./channels.mdx) for more information
- shipping zone - allows for defining the cost of shipping in different areas of the world
  with the use of shipping methods
- warehouse - contains stocks of specific products, assigned to a given channel and shipping zone,
  can be defined as the collection point
- stock - corresponds to resources of specific product variant in the given warehouse
- allocation - corresponds to the currently allocated stocks for a given order line

The relations between the mentioned entities are shown in the chart below:

```mermaid

    Channel "*" -- "*" ShippingZone
    ShippingZone "1" -- "*" ShippingMethod
    Channel "*" -- "*" Warehouse
    Warehouse "*" -- "*" ShippingZone
    Warehouse "1" -- "*" Stock
    Stock "*" -- "1" ProductVariant
    Stock "1" -- "*" Allocation
    Allocation "*" -- "1" OrderLine
    class Stock{
      quantity: Number
      quantity_allocated: Number
    }
    class Allocation{
      quantity_allocated: Number
    }
    class Warehouse{
      click_and_collect_option: String
    }
```

## Allocation flow

Stocks are allocated in the checkout completion process, for all lines
that have track inventory turned on. The allocation is made for every line
on stocks with the highest quantity available value. When there is not enough
available quantity in one stock, multiple allocations are created. In case there is
not enough quantity in all product stocks - the `InsufficientStock` error is raised.

The line can be allocated only in the stocks that fulfill the following conditions:

- the stock's warehouse is available in the channel in which the order is created
- the stock's warehouse has a shipping zone that includes the shipping address
  (or billing address if the shipping address is not set) country code
  and this shipping zone is available in the channel in which the order is created
- the stock has available quantities

## Warehouse configuration

### Warehouse creation

Firstly we need to create the warehouse with the use of
[`createWarehouse`](developer/api-reference/mutations/create-warehouse.mdx) mutation.
In the following example, we are specifying `name`, `slug`, `email` and `address` of a warehouse.

```graphql
mutation {
  createWarehouse(input: {
    name: "Example warehouse",
    slug: "example-warehouse",
    email: "example-warehouse@example.com",
    address: {
      streetAddress1: "Teczowa 8",
      city: "Wroclaw",
      country: PL,
      postalCode: "53-601",
      companyName: "Amazing Company Inc",
    }
  }){
    warehouse {
      id
      name
      slug
      email
      address {
        id
        companyName
      }
    }
    errors {
      message
      field
      code
    }
  }
```

As a response we get the newly created warehouse:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "createWarehouse": {
      "warehouse": {
        "id": "V2FyZWhvdXNlOmJjMjZiNjMzLTg0ZmItNDUxZC1hNTRjLTU1NDc1YjU5NTAzYQ==",
        "name": "Example warehouse",
        "slug": "example-warehouse",
        "email": "example-warehouse@example.com",
        "address": {
          "id": "QWRkcmVzczo2NA==",
          "companyName": "Amazing Company Inc"
        }
      },
      "errors": []
    }
  }
}
```

After the warehouse is created it can be changed with the use of
the [`updateWarehouse`](developer/api-reference/mutations/update-warehouse.mdx) mutation.
There is an option to change the following warehouse fields: `name`, `slug`, `email`, `address` and
also define privacy and `click and collect` options.

The warehouse could be defined as private or public. When the warehouse is public, the stock
is shown, otherwise it isn't.

### Click-and-collect warehouses

The`click and collect` options allowed defining the warehouse as a collection point.
Three options can be used:

- `local stock` - the stock from this warehouse is used during the fulfillment process,
  this option is only available for public warehouses
- `all warehouses` - the global stock for a given product is used during the fulfillment process,
  in this case, the available quantity is not restricted by the quantity of this warehouse,
  ordered products can be shipped from a different warehouse
- `disabled` - the warehouse cannot be used as the click and collect point

In the case of click-and-collect, warehouse availability does not depend on the shipping zones,
it's only restricted by channel relation.
So the warehouse is available for the given order as a collection point when the following two
conditions are fulfilled:

- there is a stock with available quantity for a given product
- the warehouse is available in the channel in which the order is created

### Assign warehouses to the channels

To allow assigning the warehouse to the shipping zone we need to have at least one common
channel with this zone. So firstly, we need to assign warehouses to channels with the use of
[`channelUpdate`](developer/api-reference/mutations/channel-update.mdx) mutation.
See the example below:

```graphql
  mutation {
    channelUpdate(
      id: "Q2hhbm5lbDoxMQ==",
      input: {
        "addWarehouses": ["V2FyZWhvdXNlOjA4N2I2MzhlLWIxYzYtNDk5Mi1hMWQ1LTZiOWI5N2FjODU1Zg=="]
      }
    ){
      channel{
        id
        warehouses {
          slug
        }
      }
      errors{
        field
        code
        message
        shippingZones
        warehouses
      }
    }
  }
```

As a response we get the updated channel:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "channelUpdate": {
      "channel": {
        "id": "Q2hhbm5lbDoxMQ==",
        "warehouses": [
          {
            "slug": "example-warehouse"
          }
        ]
      },
      "channelErrors": []
    }
  }
}
```

## Shipping zone configuration

Shipping zones allow defining the cost of shipping in different areas of the world.
Shipping zones contain shipping methods that are available in given countries and
channels.

Specifying shipping zones is required to allow the selling of physical products to given countries.

### Shipping zone creation and update

To create the shipping zone use [`shippingZoneCreate`](developer/api-reference/mutations/shipping-zone-create.mdx) mutation.
You can specify such fields as `name`, `description`, `countries`, `warehouses`, `channels` and
decide if the shipping zone should be used as the default one for all countries
that are not covered by other zones.

### Assigning warehouses to the shipping zone

Warehouses that are assignable to shipping zones are the subset of warehouses assigned to the channel.
So, to assign a warehouse to the shipping zone, the warehouse must be available
in at least one channel that the zone is assigned to.
This means that to assign warehouses to the shipping zone, you must first specify
the channels. You can do this during shipping zone creation by providing the
channels and warehouses together.

Below is the example for shipping zone creation with channels and warehouses.
In this case, the defined warehouse is available in the channel defined in `addChannels` field,
so it can be added to this shipping zone.

```graphql {2-12}
mutation {
  shippingZoneCreate(
    input: {
      name: "Zone A"
      description: "Description for shipping zone A."
      countries: ["US"]
      default: False
      addWarehouses: [
        "V2FyZWhvdXNlOjA4N2I2MzhlLWIxYzYtNDk5Mi1hMWQ1LTZiOWI5N2FjODU1Zg=="
      ]
      addChannels: ["Q2hhbm5lbDoxMA=="]
    }
  ) {
    shippingZone {
      id
      name
      description
      countries {
        code
      }
      default
      warehouses {
        name
      }
      channels {
        id
      }
    }
    errors {
      field
      code
      message
      channels
      warehouses
    }
  }
}
```

:::note
When adding warehouses to the shipping zone, make sure that all warehouses will have
the common channel with the shipping zone, otherwise you will get the error.
:::

As a result, we get the newly created shipping zone.

```json
"data": {
  "shippingZoneCreate": {
    "errors": [],
    "shippingZone": {
      "id": "U2hpcHBpbmdab25lOjEx",
      "name": "Zone A",
      "description": "Description for shipping zone A.",
      "countries": [
        {
          "code": "USD"
        }
      ],
      "default": False,
      "warehouses": [
        {
          "name": "ExampleWarehouse"
        }
      ],
      "channels": [
        {
          "id": "Q2hhbm5lbDoxMg=="
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

To update the shipping zone use [`shippingZoneUpdate`](developer/api-reference/mutations/shipping-zone-update.mdx) mutation.
You can change all fields that you defined during the creation process and also unlink
the channels and warehouses. Be aware that removing the channel may cause unlinking
warehouses if it was the only common channel between zone and warehouse.
When adding warehouses, as before, there must be a common channel with the shipping zone.

:::warning
Keep in mind that when the only common channel of warehouse and shipping zone
is deleted (for example after channel deletion or unlinking the warehouse or shipping zone from the channel),
the connection between the warehouse and shipping zone is deleted.
The common channel condition is mandatory.
