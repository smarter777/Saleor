## Preparation

Version 3.6 introduces some breaking changes necessary to ensure the highest quality of our API.

## New thumbnails solution

With the new thumbnail solution, the `create_thumbnails` has been dropped. Since 3.6
version, all thumbnails are created on demand. You can find more info about the new solution
in the [thumbnails section](developer/thumbnails.mdx).
