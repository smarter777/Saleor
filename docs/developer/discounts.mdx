## Introduction

There are two kinds of discounts in Saleor: `Sales` and `Vouchers`.
Discounts allow for the reduction of prices for selected variants, products, collections,
or categories by a given percentage or fixed value.
The sale discount is automatically applied to all included products, without requiring
any additional actions from the user. In contrast, vouchers require the user to provide
a code during the checkout process. Both the sale and voucher discounts can be used together.

### Sale

As mentioned earlier, sales are automatically applied when a product is added to the checkout.
For instance, if a product is priced at **$9** and has a **10%** discount, it will be available for **$8.1**.
The discount will be visible on line prices. To calculate the total applied discount,
subtract the `line.undiscountedTotalPrice` from the `line.totalPrice`.
To calculate the discount on one unit, subtract the `line.undiscountedUnitPrice` from the `line.unitPrice`.

:::info
The sale discount is not visible on `checkout.discount.amount`.

Consider the following example: after adding a product on sale to the checkout,
the response will include the discounted price of the product.

```graphql
mutation {
  checkoutLinesAdd(
    checkoutId: "Q2hlY2tvdXQ6NzMwMzkwMmItZGRhOC00MzU3LTk1YTAtNjRiODNiNTllMmUy"
    lines: { quantity: 1, variantId: "UHJvZHVjdFZhcmlhbnQ6Mzcx" }
  ) {
    errors {
      message
    }
    checkout {
      discount {
        amount
      }
      token
      lines {
        quantity
        variant {
          name
        }
        totalPrice {
          gross {
            amount
          }
          net {
            amount
          }
        }
        undiscountedTotalPrice {
          amount
        }
        unitPrice {
          gross {
            amount
          }
          net {
            amount
          }
        }
        undiscountedUnitPrice {
          amount
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Please check the line prices in the following response.
The line.totalPrice is 8.1, and the line.undiscountedTotalPrice is 9.0.

### Voucher

There are three types of vouchers:

- Fixed amount: reduces the price by a specified value.
- Percentage: reduces the price by a specified percentage value.
- Free shipping: zeros out the shipping price.

The voucher can be applied to all checkout products, or only to specified ones.

There is also an option to apply the discount only to the cheapest eligible product.
If the voucher specifies certain products, the discount will be applied only to
the cheapest item included in the discount. If the voucher applies to all products,
the discount will be applied only to the cheapest item overall.

To apply the voucher on checkout use [checkoutAddPromoCode](api-reference/mutations/checkout-add-promo-code.mdx)
mutation. The discount will be visible both in the line prices and in the `checkout.discount` field.

```graphql

```

Let's see the example:

Applying the entire order voucher

```graphql

```

The discount is visible on `checkout.lines`, the `total_price` is less by .. than the
`undiscounted_prcie`. The sum of the difference between `total_price` and `undiscounted_prcie`
of lines gives the `checkout.discount_amount`.

Specific product - one line in discount one not

```graphql

```

Here we see that the discount was applied only on the cheapest line from lines that are
included in the voucher discount.
