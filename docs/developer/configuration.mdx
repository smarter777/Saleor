title: Configuration
---

Saleor follows the [12 factor](https://12factor.net/) approach so you can configure Saleor using environment variables.

Below is a list of available environment variables and their default values.

## General Configuration

### `ALLOWED_CLIENT_HOSTS`

A list of strings representing host/domain names of client applications (storefront or dashboard) that use this Saleor instance as a backend. Values in this list should be URLs in [RFC 1808](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1808) format.

Some operations, such as registering a new account or resetting the password, involve sending an email from the backend with a link that users need to click to confirm the action. The backend doesn't know the structure of frontend applications' routing and the path to the view where users can proceed with the operation needs to be passed as arguments in GraphQL mutations. These paths are validated against URLs configured in the `ALLOWED_CLIENT_HOSTS` setting.

`ALLOWED_CLIENT_HOSTS` is required in production mode (with `DEBUG=False`). In local development (`DEBUG=True`) when it's not set, the paths are validated against `localhost, 127.0.0.1`.

Multiple values should be separated with a comma.

### `ALLOWED_GRAPHQL_ORIGINS`

Controls the value of [`Access-Control-Allow-Origin`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Access-Control-Allow-Origin) response header. Defaults to `*`.

### `ALLOWED_HOSTS`

This variable controls [Django’s allowed hosts](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/ref/settings/#allowed-hosts) setting. It defaults to `localhost`.

Multiple values should be separated with a comma.

### `CACHE_URL` or `REDIS_URL`

The URL of a cache database. It defaults to local process memory.

Use of Redis is recommended. Heroku’s Redis will export this setting automatically.

**Example**: `redis://redis.example.com:6379/0`

### `CREATE_IMAGES_ON_DEMAND`

Indicates whether or not new images are created on-the-fly. By default it is set to `True`.
For production, we recommend you set this to `False` to speed the performance.
Make sure all images come with a pre-warm to ensure they’re created and available at the appropriate URL.

To create missing thumbnails for all images use:

```shell
python manage.py create_thumbnails
```

### `DATABASE_URL`

This variable defaults to a local PostgreSQL instance.

Most Heroku databases will export this settings automatically.

**Example:** `postgres://user:password@psql.example.com/database`

### `DEBUG`

Controls [Django’s debug mode](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/ref/settings/#s-debug). It defaults to `True`.

### `DEFAULT_COUNTRY`

Indicates the default country of your store. Depending on what setup you require, this variable also controls the default VAT, shipping country, etc.

### `DEFAULT_CURRENCY`

Indicates a default currency which is a basis for all prices entered and stored in your store.

### `DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL`

Indicates a default email address to use for all outgoing mail.

### `ENABLE_DEBUG_TOOLBAR`

Controls whether to run [Django Debug Toolbar](https://django-debug-toolbar.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). Defaults to `False`.

To use the toolbar, you also need to enable the `PLAYGROUND_ENABLED` setting. Then, the toolbar will be rendered when accessing the `/graphql/` URL.
Note that using the toolbar is recommended only locally and should be disabled in production, as it affects the performance and may potentially reveal sensitive or private information.

### `EMAIL_URL`

The URL of the email gateway. Defaults to printing everything to the console.

**Example:** `smtp://user:password@smtp.example.com:465/?ssl=True`

### `ENABLE_ACCOUNT_CONFIRMATION_BY_EMAIL`

Controls whether registering new customer accounts should require email confirmation. Requires [`ALLOWED_CLIENT_HOSTS`](#allowed_client_hosts) variable to be set.

Defaults to `True`.

### `INTERNAL_IPS`

Controls [Django’s internal IPs setting](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/ref/settings/#s-internal-ips). Defaults to `127.0.0.1`.

Multiple values should be separated with a comma.

### `MAX_CHECKOUT_LINE_QUANTITY`

Controls the maximum quantity of a line item that can be added to checkout. Defaults to `50`.

### `MEDIA_URL`

Controls [Django's `MEDIA_URL`](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/ref/settings/#media-url) setting. Defaults to `/media/`.

### `PLAYGROUND_ENABLED`

Controls whether to run [Playground](https://github.com/prisma-labs/graphql-playground) - the interactive GraphQL explorer - when accessing the `/graphql` URL exposed by Saleor. Default to `True`.

### `SECRET_KEY`

Controls [Django’s secret key](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/ref/settings/#s-secret-key) setting.

### `STATIC_URL`

Controls the production assets mount path. Defaults to `/static/`.

## Tax Configuration

For more information on how to configure taxes in Saleor, see the [taxes](guides/taxes.md) topic of the _How to_ section.

### `VATLAYER_ACCESS_KEY`

Indicates an access key to [vatlayer’s API](https://vatlayer.com/).

### `AVATAX_USERNAME_OR_ACCOUNT`

This variable stores Avalara’s `username` or `account`.

### `AVATAX_PASSWORD_OR_LICENSE`

This variable stores Avalara’s `password` or `license`.

### `AVATAX_USE_SANDBOX`

`True` when `DEBUG` is set to `True`. This variable determines if Saleor should use the Avatax sandbox API.

### `AVATAX_COMPANY_NAME`

Defaults to `DEFAULT`. Avalara needs to receive a company code. Some more complicated systems can use more than one company code; in such cases, this variable should be changed based on data from Avalara’s admin panel.

### `AVATAX_AUTOCOMMIT`

Defaults to `False`. This variable determines if all transactions sent to Avalara should be committed by default.
