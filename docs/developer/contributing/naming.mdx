title: Naming Conventions
---

To keep a consistent code structure, we follow some rules when naming files.

## Python Modules

The name should reflect the function of the file. If possible, avoid generic file names such as `utils.py`.

## Static Assets

Use dashes to separate words as they end up as part of the URL.
