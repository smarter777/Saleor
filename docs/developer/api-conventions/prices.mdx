## Introduction 

Saleor API has four different types that represent prices. The most basic type consists of a currency code and a numeric amount. The most complex one can represent a range of prices including net, gross, and tax amounts.

Saleor does not enforce any particular set of currency codes but we strongly recommend using the three-letter codes defined by the [ISO 4217 standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217). 

## Displaying prices

How a number is presented depends on the language and region. If you are building a web application, we recommend that you use the [`Intl.NumberFormat`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl/NumberFormat) API.

## API Reference

### Money
[`Money`](developer/api-reference/objects/money.mdx) is a basic type for keeping prices without taxes. We do not restrict currency code values, so a user use crypto-currencies or other custom currency.

```graphql
type Money {
  currency: String!
  amount: Float!
}
```

- `currency`: Currency code for price. Currency depends on chosen Channel.
- `amount`: Price amount.

## TaxedMoney
The most common example of [`TaxedMoney`](developer/api-reference/objects/taxed-money.mdx) is a [`ProductVariant`](developer/api-reference/objects/product-variant.mdx) price. If a user does not use any tax integration, both net and gross prices will be populated with the same value.

```graphql
type TaxedMoney {
  currency: String!
  gross: Money!
  net: Money!
  tax: Money!
}
```

- `currency`: Currency code for price. Currency depends on chosen Channel.
- `gross`: Gross value (price with taxes).
- `net`: Net value (price without taxes).
- `tax`: Tax value.

## MoneyRange
[`MoneyRange`](developer/api-reference/objects/money-range.mdx) is used to display prices for a [`ShippingZone`](developer/api-reference/objects/shipping-zone.mdx).

```graphql
type MoneyRange {
  start: Money
  stop: Money
}
```

- `start`: Lowest price in the range.
- `stop`: Highest price in the range.

## TaxedMoneyRange
[`TaxedMoneyRange`](developer/api-reference/objects/taxed-money-range.mdx) is used in [`Products`](developer/api-reference/objects/product.mdx), because variants can differ in prices. You can display it as "price starts from $10" or "$10â€“$20".

```graphql
type TaxedMoneyRange {
  start: TaxedMoney
  stop: TaxedMoney
}
```

- `start`: Lowest price in the range.
- `stop`: Highest price in the range.
