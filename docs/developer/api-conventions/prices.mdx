## Introduction 

Saleor API have 4 different types for prices, depending on taxes and eventual price range. 
Althrough using [ISO 4217](https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217) codes for currency is recommended, we allow using custom ones. 

## Frontend integration

Displaying prices vary in different regions. If you are building your own storefront, you can use [`Intl.NumberFormat`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl/NumberFormat) if you plan to translate your application to different languages.


# Api Reference

### Money
[`Money`](developer/api-reference/objects/money.mdx) is a basic type for keeping prices without taxes. We do not restrict currency code values, so you can even use cryptocurrencies or other custom currency.

```graphql
type Money {
  currency: String!
  amount: Float!
}
```

- `currency`: Currency code for price. Currency depends on chosen Channel.
- `amount`: Price amount.

## TaxedMoney
Most used example of [`TaxedMoney`](developer/api-reference/objects/taxed-money.mdx) is [`ProductVariant`](developer/api-reference/objects/product-variant.mdx) price. Even if you do not use any taxes integration, both net and gross prices will be populated with the same value.

```graphql
type TaxedMoney {
  currency: String!
  gross: Money!
  net: Money!
  tax: Money!
}
```

- `currency`: Currency code for price. Currency depends on chosen Channel.
- `gross`: Gross value (price with taxes).
- `net`: Net value (price without taxes).
- `tax`: Tax value.

## MoneyRange
[`MoneyRange`](developer/api-reference/objects/money-range.mdx) is used in displaying price for [`ShippingZone`](developer/api-reference/objects/shipping-zone.mdx).

```graphql
type MoneyRange {
  start: Money
  stop: Money
}
```

- `start`: Lowest price in the range.
- `stop`: Highest price in the range.

## TaxedMoneyRange
[`TaxedMoneyRange`](developer/api-reference/objects/taxed-money-range.mdx) is used in Product, because variants can differ in prices. You can display it as "price starts from $10" or "$10-$20".

```graphql
type TaxedMoneyRange {
  start: TaxedMoney
  stop: TaxedMoney
}
```

- `start`: Lowest price in the range.
- `stop`: Highest price in the range.
