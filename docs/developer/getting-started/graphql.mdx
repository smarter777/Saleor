Saleor is powered by a GraphQL API. GraphQL is a query language that allows clients to talk to an API server. Unlike REST, it gives the client control over how much or how little data they want to request about each object and allows relations within the object graph to be traversed easily.

To learn more about GraphQL language and its concepts, see the official [GraphQL website](https://graphql.org/).

Using the Saleor GraphQL API allows you to query and modify all of your shopâ€™s data in an efficient and flexible manner. Our API provides both types of operations:

- Public (related to the customers of your shop)
- Private (related to the administration side)

Here's an example query to fetch the store's name:

<GraphQL
  height={15}
  query={`query Foo {
  shop {
    name
  }
}`}
/>
