## Playground

Saleor exposes an interactive GraphQL editor under `/graphql/`, allowing access to the API from your browser.

GraphQL Playground is an external interactive editor for your GraphQL queries. It is based on GraphQL and accessible through the web browser.

Using Playground is easy and intuitive with its sidebar navigation containing two tabs (_Docs_ and _Schema_), listing all operations available in the API. The Playground allows you to quickly familiarize yourself with the API, perform example operations, and send your first queries.

To view and try out the Playground instance of Saleor's demo store, visit the [Saleor Demo Playground](https://demo.saleor.io/graphql/).

For more information, visit the [Playground GitHub page](https://github.com/prisma/graphql-playground).

### Authentication

To run queries as the authenticated user, you need to add headers to your request. The headers section is located at the bottom left side of the Playground. To read more, how to get auth tokens, read [User documentation](developer/users.mdx#authentication).

## Inspectors for browsers

You can learn about Saleor API by interacting with [Dashboard](https://github.com/saleor/saleor-dashboard) or [Storefront](https://github.com/saleor/react-storefront) and observing requests using browser extensions:

[Chrome: GraphQL Inspector](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/graphql-network-inspector/ndlbedplllcgconngcnfmkadhokfaaln)

[Firefox: Graphql Developer Tools](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/graphql-developer-tools/)

## Codegen

[GraphQL Code Generation](https://www.graphql-code-generator.com/) can automate creation of GraphQL requests, typings and more. You can use [React Storefront](https://github.com/saleor/saleor-storefront) for reference how to configure codegen in a Typescript project, but similar setup can be achieved in [other languages](https://www.graphql-code-generator.com/plugins).
