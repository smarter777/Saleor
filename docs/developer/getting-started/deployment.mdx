## Overview

When deploying Saleor, we suggest the containerized approach. The platform consists of several applications, each having its own set of dependencies, so maintaining their environments can be time-consuming.

However, our documentation also covers the deployment to Heroku which doesn't require Docker. You can find tutorials for both options below:
