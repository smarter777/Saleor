The following instructions assume a 64-bit installation of Windows 10.

## Prerequisites

Before you are ready to run Saleor, you will need additional software installed on your computer.

### Python

Saleor requires **Python 3.8** or later. Go to the [Python download page](https://www.python.org/downloads/) for the installer and installation guide for your operating system. You can also use [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) to install and manage Python versions.

Make sure that “**Add Python 3.8 to PATH**” is selected.

### PostgreSQL

Saleor needs **PostgreSQL** version **9.6** or above to work. Get the Windows installer from the [project’s download page](https://www.postgresql.org/download/windows/).

:::note
Make sure you remember the password you chose for the administrator account during the installation process.
:::

### GTK+

Download and install the [64-bit Windows installer](https://github.com/tschoonj/GTK-for-Windows-Runtime-Environment-Installer).

Make sure that “**Set up PATH environment variable to include GTK+**” is selected.

### Compilers

Download and install the latest version of the [Build Tools for Visual Studio](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=840931).

## Installation

Once you have installed or updated the pre-requisite software, you are ready to install Saleor. Follow the steps below to start and execute the process:

:::note
All commands need to be performed in either a PowerShell terminal or a Windows Command Prompt.
:::

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```shell
git clone https://github.com/mirumee/saleor.git
```

Replace the URL with your own if using a custom fork.

### Step 2: Enter the Directory

```shell
cd saleor/
```

### Step 3: Install the Dependencies

We strongly recommend [creating a virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html) before installing any Python packages.

```shell
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 4: Choose a `SECRET_KEY`

We try to provide usable default values for all the settings. We have decided not to provide a default for `SECRET_KEY` as we fear someone would inevitably ship a project with the default value left in code.

Use the following command to temporarily set an environment variable that will only persist until the terminal window is closed:

<Tabs defaultValue="cmd" values={[
  { label: "Command Prompt", value: "cmd" },
  { label: "PowerShell", value: "ps" }
]}>
<TabItem value="cmd">

```shell
set SECRET_KEY "<mysecretkey>"
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="ps">

```shell
$Env:SECRET_KEY = "<mysecretkey>"
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

To permanently set the variable:

```shell
setx SECRET_KEY "<mysecretkey>"
```

:::caution
The secret key should be a unique string that only your team knows. Running the code with a known `SECRET_KEY` defeats many of Django’s security protections. It can also lead to privilege escalation and remote code execution vulnerabilities. Consult [Django’s documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/ref/settings/#secret-key) for details.
:::

### Step 5: Create a Database User

Use the **pgAdmin** tool that comes with your PostgreSQL installation to create a database user for your store.

Unless configured otherwise, the store will use `saleor` as both the username and password. Remember to assign your user the `SUPERUSER` privilege. This will allow you to create databases and database extensions.

### Step 6: Create a Database

See [PostgreSQL’s createdb command](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/app-createdb.html) for details.

:::note
The database name is extracted from the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable. If absent, it defaults to `saleor`.
:::

### Step 7: Prepare the Database

```shell
python manage.py migrate
```

:::note
This command creates database extensions. If you get an error related to the `CREATE EXTENSION` command, please return to the instructions in the PostgreSQL user creation step.
:::

## Starting the Development Server

```shell
python manage.py runserver
```
