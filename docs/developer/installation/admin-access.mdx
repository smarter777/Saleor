You can use the following command to create your administrator account:

```shell
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

Follow the prompts providing your email address and a password to use.

:::note
This method creates users with "superuser" status, meaning they have all system privileges, regardless of the specific permission set granted to them. Do not use this command to create regular staff accounts.
