Saleor is a 12-factor application that is configured using environment variables. We recommend using Docker because it takes care of all necessary dependencies.

## Prerequisites

You need to install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) before following the instructions below.

:::caution
To install Docker Desktop on Windows Home, please follow the [instructions](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install-windows-home/).
:::

## Installation using Docker Compose

<!-- todo: rephrase to put emphasis on saleor-platform -->

The following steps need to be performed inside a terminal window (Windows users may prefer to use the [Windows Terminal](https://aka.ms/windowsterminal), but the Command Prompt will also work).

Clone the repository and build Docker images:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/saleor/saleor-platform.git --recursive --jobs 3
cd saleor-platform
docker-compose build
```

Saleor uses shared folders to enable live code reloading. If you're using **Windows** or **MacOS** you will need to:

- Add the cloned `saleor-platform` directory to the list of shared directories in Docker (_Settings_ -> _Shared Drives_ or _Preferences_ -> _Resources_ -> _File sharing_).
- Make sure that in Docker preferences you have dedicated at least 5 GB of memory (_Settings_ -> _Advanced_ or _Preferences_ -> _Resources_ -> _Advanced_).

Apply database migrations, collect static assets:

```shell
docker-compose run --rm api python3 manage.py migrate
docker-compose run --rm api python3 manage.py collectstatic --noinput
```

Optionally, populate the database with sample data and create the admin user:

```shell
docker-compose run --rm api python3 manage.py populatedb
```

Finally, create an admin account:

```shell
docker-compose run --rm api python3 manage.py createsuperuser
```

## Running the services

Use the following command to run all Saleor containers (from within the `saleor-platform` directory):

```shell
docker-compose up
```

:::note
Both storefront and dashboard are relatively large frontend projects, and it might take up to a few minutes for them to compile, depending on your CPU. If nothing shows up on port 3001 or 9000, wait until `Compiled successfully` shows in the console output.
:::

## Troubleshooting

Make sure Docker and Docker Compose work before attempting to run Saleor. We won't be able to assist with your Docker installation.

Make sure you've read the warning about Windows 10 Home. Windows versions before Windows 10 are not officially supported.

If you encounter other problems, see [Support](community/support.mdx).
