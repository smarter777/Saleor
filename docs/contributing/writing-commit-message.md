title: Writing Good Commit Message
---

To speed up the review process and to keep the logs tidy, we recommend the following simple rules on how to write good commit messages:

## Summary line

* It should take up to 50 characters. It is best to make it short

* Introduce what has changed, using the imperative mood, so: fix, add, modify, etc

## Description 

* Add extra explanation, if you feel it is helpful to understand the summary content

* If you want, use bullet points (hyphen or an asterisk)

* Avoid writing in one line, use line breaks, so the reader does not have to scroll horizontally

> **Tip**
>
> Try to limit your commits to a single, self contained issue - if possible. It will be easier to review. It will also help to manage it and understand the future.
