## Introduction

This page allows you to define the types of content pages used in your stores. You will be able to use a different content type for each store.

### How to create a page type

To create a page type, click the _CREATE PAGE TYPE_ button in the page types section of dashboard configuration. The next step is to provide the content type name under the general information card.

Once the page type has been created, you can assign the content attributes. Click the _ASSIGN ATTRIBUTE_ button. The content attributes list shows all attributes that can be assigned to the page types.
