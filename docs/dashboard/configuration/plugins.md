This page gives you a convenient overview of currently installed plugins in Saleor.
Saleor provides the possibility to add various extensions to it so you can create your own configuration. 

Using plugins also allows you to avoid working directly on the code. Code modifications could be problematic, especially when downloading updates or upgrading to the latest Saleor version, and can lead to conflicts in the code.

The plugin page is used to display general information about installed plugins, along with their activation status (active or not active). 

<!--screenshot of the main list page, once its available - use the white layout! -->

If you choose to, you can use the plugin window to display the basic configuration to allow dashboard users to manage the elemental settings of existing plugins. 

However, for more detailed information about plugins and our Extension Manager, see the [Extensions](advanced/extensions.md) topic in the chapter for developers.

Saleor arrives with two plugins already integrated. They are used to configure taxes in Saleor:

* Vatlayer 

* Avalara
