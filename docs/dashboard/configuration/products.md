## Introduction

This page allows you to define the type of products you sell. A product type is a kind of a template upon which the specific products are then created. Multiple products can use the same Product Type. Defining templates (Product Types) makes adding products much easier.

The list displayed on the Product Types page shows the names of existing product types, information if a product type has a physical or digital form, and which tax applies to its sale.

## Product type setup

Each product type page consist of the following cards:

### Information

Here you can enter your Product Type Name. For example, a product: _bike_ comes under a product type: _sporting goods_.

### Shipping

In this card you can determine if your products is physical and thus can be send to customers. To do that, select the [[Is&nbsp;this&nbsp;product&nbsp;shippable?]] checkbox. An additional field will then appear to note the weight of the products. Indicating the weight is essential for calculating shipping costs correctly.

### Taxes

Different goods are taxed differently across the world. If you leave the Tax Rate field blank, the system will assume that the product is classified as a standard taxable item. Click on the drop-down list to assign non-standard classifications. 

This is very important, as it means you are legally charging the correct amount for products. For example, educational materials may be tax exempt, while some hazardous substances have higher tax rates.


## How to add a product type

Click [[Add&nbsp;Product&nbsp;Type]] above the main product types list. Enter the required data into the Information, Shipping, and Taxes cards. 

Once the new Product Type is saved, a Product Attributes card appears.

### How to add attributes and variants

Once you have created your Product Type and added tax and shipping information, click [[Save]]. An additional card will appear for adding Attributes and Variants to the Product Type. Click [[Assign&nbsp;Attribute]] and select the attributes from the list. 

If your product has different variants, select the [[This&nbsp;product&nbsp;has&nbsp;variants]] checkbox to open a new Variant Attributes card. Click [[Assign&nbsp;Attribute]] and select the variants of your attribute. Click [[Save]]. 

> **Note**
> 
> Only the attributes with the input type (in the Attribute setup page) set to _Dropdown_ may be used as Variant Attributes. 
> 
> In other words, when setting up your Product Type, you select a Variant Attribute which is set up as _Multiselect_, you will receive the following error message: "Variants are disabled in this product type".

## How to delete a product type

There are two ways to remove a Product Type:

- Select it from the main list, then choose [[Remove]] in the footer
- Check the box on the main list and then click the trash can that appears above. You can remove single or multiple product types simultaneously from the list.

Confirm the cancellation in both cases by clicking [[Delete]] in the pop-up window.
