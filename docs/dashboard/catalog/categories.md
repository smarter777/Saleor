Products on the Saleor platform can be sorted by category if you sell a range of items.


## Adding a Category

Click on the [[Add&nbsp;Category]] icon to enter a new set of products. Enter the category name, description, and SEO-optimized information the same way as you would with an individual product. When finished, click [[Save&nbsp;Category]] in the bottom right corner and then add a widescreen banner photo that will appear at the top of the screen when customers view the category.

## Editing Categories

Once you have your categories, you can edit them at any time by clicking on a category from the list and changing information. When viewing a category, at the bottom of a section, you have information listing all products in the category, which can be individually clicked and edited, just as in the main products section. 


## Adding Sub-categories

Sub-categories break large groups down into smaller subsets that make it easier to manage stores and help customers find the right products. To add a sub-category, click [[Add&nbsp;Subcategory]] text in the top right corner of the sub-categories box.

In this example, we have paints and cushions in the Accessories category, which can be marked as separate sub-categories. Add a description and SEO information just the same as with a main category.

## Deleting Categories

To remove a category, simply click the [[Delete&nbsp;Category]] button in the footer 

> **Caution** 
>
> Products are mandatorily assigned to categories. Deleting a category will also remove all products it contains. Only remove a category if you are sure that you also want to permanently delete all its products from your catalog.
