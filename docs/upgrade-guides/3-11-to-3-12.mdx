title: Upgrading from 3.11.x to 3.12
---

## Preparation

Version 3.12 introduces new fields in our model. To properly migrate from to 3.12 please migrate first to version 3.11.4

## Reasoning

In version 3.12 `orderSettings` were moved to `Channel`. For more info relate to https://github.com/saleor/saleor/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md
In case of not following the guide may happen unexpected state of `orderSettings` data.
