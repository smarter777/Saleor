title: Upgrading from 3.11 to 3.12
---

## Preparation

Version 3.12 introduces some breaking changes necessary to ensure the highest quality of our API.
To follow the zero-downtime strategy when upgrading from older versions to 3.12
you need to migrate to 3.11.4 first. Otherwise, you will need to downtime your solution to ensure correct data migration.

## Order settings moved to Channel type

Version 3.12 introduces new fields to the database `Channel` model which results in the need for data migrations.
In version 3.12 [`orderSettings`](../api-reference/queries/order-settings) were moved to [`Channel`](../api-reference/objects/channel), which includes
moving data between database models and changing the schema.
For more related information please refer to [Changelog](https://github.com/saleor/saleor/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).
In case of not following this guideline may happen an unexpected state of [`orderSettings`](../api-reference/queries/order-settings) data.
