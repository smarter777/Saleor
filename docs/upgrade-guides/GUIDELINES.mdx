# How to write an upgrade guide

## Guidelines

### Structure

The upgrade guide should be structured as follows:

1. Introduction/context (no heading)
2. Upgrade step for each breaking change (h2)

### Writing

Please try to be as concise as possible. The upgrade guide should be a quick reference for developers who want to upgrade their project to the latest version. Focus on actionables and reference other documents for context.

## Example upgrade guide

This migration guide describes the upgrade from version 1.0.0 to 1.1.0. Version 1.1.0 contains the following breaking changes:

- The `foo` function has been removed.
- The `bar` function has been renamed to `baz`.

To successfully upgrade to version 1.1.0, you need to perform these steps:

`## Upgrading the dependencies`

1. Non eiusmod esse incididunt.
2. Aliquip veniam do consectetur consequat tempor aute culpa qui sunt mollit enim enim qui nisi.
3. Nisi in laborum officia enim.

`## Fixing the type errors`

Dolor adipisicing excepteur sit ad reprehenderit eu voluptate id consectetur deserunt:
