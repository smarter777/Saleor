export const Tag = ({children, color}) => (
<span
style={{
      backgroundColor: color,
      borderRadius: '2px',
      color: '#fff',
      padding: '0.2rem',
    }}>
{children}
</span>
);

Allows use of a JSON String for input / output from the GraphQL schema.

Use of this type is _not recommended_ as you lose the benefits of having a defined, static
schema (one of the key benefits of GraphQL).

```graphql
scalar JSONString
```
