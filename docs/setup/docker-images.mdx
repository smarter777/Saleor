title: Docker Images
---

If you choose to self-host, Docker is Saleor's preferred method of deployment.

## Saleor Core

Saleor publishes official Docker images for all releases. The images can be found on [GitHub Container Registry](https://github.com/saleor/saleor/pkgs/container/saleor).

If you want to build the image yourself, use `docker build` in the `saleor` directory:

```shell
cd saleor
docker build -t <yourimagename> .
```

The image is suitable for production use. See the [Configuration](configuration.mdx) for a list of environment variables you can use to configure the container.

## Saleor Dashboard

The [Dashboard](https://github.com/saleor/saleor-dashboard) is a static application that does not require a backend server.

You can deploy it using Docker but consider using a dedicated static hosting platform like Amazon S3 and CloudFront, or Vercel, instead.
