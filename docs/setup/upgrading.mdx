title: Upgrading Saleor
---

No matter how you choose to install the software, you will need to upgrade it from time to time. Follow these steps to upgrade your installation:

1. Download the latest release of Saleor and make sure it's connected to the same database that your existing installation was using.

2. Stop the Celery workers to make sure they don't process any tasks while the database is being upgraded.

3. Run the following command to upgrade the database schema:

   ```bash
   docker compose run --rm api python3 manage.py migrate
   ```

   Or, if you don't use Docker:

   ```bash
   python3 manage.py migrate
   ```

4. Upgrade the web workers and Celery workers to run the new version of the code.

5. Start the Celery workers again.

For instructions specific to upgrading between particular versions, see the [upgrade guides](../category/upgrade-guides).
