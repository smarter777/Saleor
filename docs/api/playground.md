title: How to Access the Playground
---

GraphQL Playground is an external interactive editor for your GraphQL queries. It is based on the GraphiQL and accessible through the web browser. 

With the `DEBUG=True` setting enabled, Saleor exposes an interactive GraphQL editor under `/graphql`, allowing to access the API from your browser. To view and try out our API, visit the [Playground](https://demo.getsaleor.com/graphql/).

Using Playground is easy and intuitive with its sidebar navigation containing two tab (_Docs_ and _Schema_), listing all operations available in Saleor API. The Playground allows you to quickly familiarize yourself with API, perform example operations and send your first queries.
