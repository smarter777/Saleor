To keep a consistent code structure, we follow some rules when naming files.


## Python modules

The name should reflect the function of the file. If possible, avoid generic file names such as `utils.py`.


## Django templates

Use underscore as a word separator.


## Static files

Use dashes to separate words as they end up as part of the URL.
