We have built-in support for the following debug tools:

### Django debug toolbar

[Django Debug Toolbar](https://github.com/jazzband/django-debug-toolbar) is turned on if Django is running in debug mode.

### Silk

You can control Silkâ€™s presence via the environmental variable `ENABLE_SILK`. It controls django-silk and defaults to <em>False</em>.


#### Setting environment variable

```console
$ export ENABLE_SILK='True'
```

> To process your changes, you need to restart the server.
