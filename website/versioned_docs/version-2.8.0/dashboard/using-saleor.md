## About the Dashboard

The [Saleor 2.0](https://saleor.io/blog/saleor-release-graphqlfirst-headless-ecommerce-102/) dashboard is the administration panel behind your storefront. In a nutshell, it is for managing people, products, and processes:

- People: Assign and manage staff within your system
- Products: Add, change, display, and delete digital and physical inventory
- Processes: Manage important e-commerce elements like taxes, payments, and shipping


## Accessing the Dashboard

### Setting Up Your Account

The first thing you need to do is set up a master account for your store—sometimes called an Admin Account or a Superuser Account. This is done by your developer when forking the platform and setting up your iteration of Saleor. You just need to supply the developer with the details of your main administrator and the setup password.


### Accessing Your Dashboard

Once you have your store, you can access the administration panel by: 

- Clicking _dashboard_ on the right side of the top navigation bar of your store’s front page
- Entering `www.YOURSTORENAME/dashboard` into the web browser

You will then be asked to input the email address and password you used to create your superuser account. Each new user can access the dashboard the same way using their unique credentials.


## Dashboard Sections

The dashboard is split into sections where you can complete different tasks. The whole experience is designed by our UX experts to be intuitive and simple.
